Simmer,Petals for Armor,"[Verse 1]
Rage is a quiet thing
Ooh, you think that you've tamed it
But it's just lying in wait
Rage, is it in our veins?
Feel it in my face when
When I least expect it


[Refrain]
Give in


[Chorus]
Control
There's so many ways to give in
Eyes closed
Another way to make it to ten

Oh, how to draw the line between wrath and mercy?

Gotta simmer, simmer, simmer, simmer, simmer down

Control
There's so many ways to give in
Eyes closed
Another way to make it to ten

Oh, how to draw the line between wrath and mercy?

Gotta simmer, simmer, simmer, simmer, simmer down


[Verse 2]
If I had seen my reflection
As something more precious
He would've never
Mmm, and if my child needed protection
From a fucker like that man
I'd sooner gut him
'Cause nothing cuts like a mother

[Refrain]
Give in


[Chorus]
Control
There's so many ways to give in
Eyes closed
Another way to make it to ten

Oh, how to draw the line between wrath and mercy?

Simmer, simmer, simmer, simmer, simmer down

Control
There's so many ways to give in
Eyes closed
Another way to make it to ten

Oh, how to draw the line between wrath and mercy?

(Simmer, simmer, simmer, simmer, simmer, simmer)
Gotta simmer, simmer, simmer, simmer, simmer down


[Bridge]
(Simmer, simmer, simmer, simmer)
(Simmer, simmer, simmer, simmer, simmer)

Wrap yourself in petals
(Yourself)

Wrap yourself in petals
(Control, yourself)

Wrap yourself in petals for armor
(Control, control)

(Simmer, simmer, simmer, simmer, simmer, simmer)

Petals

(Simmer, simmer, simmer, simmer, simmer)

For armor

(Simmer, simmer, simmer, simmer, simmer, simmer)
(Simmer, simmer, simmer)

[Refrain]
Give in


[Chorus]
Control
There's so many ways to give in
Eyes closed
Another way to make it to ten

Oh, how to draw the line between wrath and mercy?

Gotta simmer, simmer, simmer, simmer, simmer down

Control
There's so many ways to give in
Eyes closed
Another way to make it to ten

Oh, how to draw the line between wrath and mercy?

Gotta simmer, simmer, simmer"
Leave It Alone,Petals for Armor,"[Verse 1]
Don't nobody tell me
That God don't have a sense of humor
'Cause now that I want to live
Well, everybody around me is dying

Now that I finally wanna live
The ones I love are dyin'
Becoming friends with a noose that I made
And I keep tryin' to untie it
Make it into something useful
Or maybe hang it through a window pane
Turn it into a fire escape


[Chorus]
It tastes so bitter on my tongue
The truth's a killer
But I can't leave it alone
But I can't leave it alone
But I can't leave it alone

[Verse 2]
You don't remember my name somedays
Or that we're related
It triggers my worry
Who else am I gonna lose before I am ready?
And who's gonna lose me?

[Chorus]
It tastes so bitter on my tongue
The truth's a killer
But I can't leave it alone
But I can't leave it alone
But I can't leave it alone
But I can't leave it a-

[Verse 3]
If you know love
You best prepare to grieve
Let it enter your open heart and
Then prepare to let it leave

[Chorus]
It tastes so bitter
The truth's a killer
But I can't leave it alone
But I can't leave it alone
But I can't leave it alone
But I can't leave it alone
But I can't leave it a-
But I can't leave it a-"

Aiming like a laser pointer
Poor little vampire baby
We bleed holy water


[Chorus]
So why you creepin' 'round here?
(Why you creepin'? Why you creepin'?)
Why you creepin' 'round?

[Verse 2]
Strange you're not a threat to me
And I admire your dedication
Poor little vampire
Don't you know
That I'm a moon in daylight?

Why you creepin' 'round here?
(Why you creepin'? Why you creepin'?)

Sudden Desire,Petals for Armor,"""Sudden Desire"", the closing track to Hayley's first EP, sees her with the urge to connect with someone in a romantic fashion.
[Verse 1]
I wanted him to kiss me how
With open mouth and open mouth
We keep our distance now
I wanna feel his hands go down
I try not to think about
What happened last night outside his house
Too far to go back now
Just wanna feel his hands go down

[Refrain]
Sudden
Sudden desi - 
Sudden
Sudden desi - 
A sudden desire


[Verse 2]
Take the elephant by the hand and hold it
It's cruel to tame a thing that don't know its strength
But better to walk beside it
Than underneath
My kind companion
Softened stone
My gentle giant
Painful reminder

[Chorus]
Don't look in my eyes (Sudden)
I feel a sudden desire (Sudden desire)
Don't know if I can deny (Sudden)
A sudden desire (Sudden desire)
Your fingerprints on my skin
A painful reminder
Don't look in my eyes (Sudden)
I feel a sudden desire (Sudden desire)
A sudden desire


[Bridge]
Won't fit in the room, big balloon
Trails me 'cause I can't let go
Everywhere I am, it sticks close like a friend
Just like him
Just like him
Friendly reminder of a sudden desire


[Chorus]
Don't look in my eyes (Sudden)
I feel a sudden desire (Sudden desire)
Don't know if I can deny (Sudden)
A sudden desire (Sudden desire)
Your fingerprints on my skin
A painful reminder
Don't look in my eyes (Sudden)
I feel a sudden desire (Sudden desire)

I wanted him to kiss me how
With open mouth and open mouth
We keep our distance now
I wanna feel his hand go down
I try not to think about
What happened last night outside his house
Too far to go back now
Just wanna feel his hands go down"
Dead Horse,Petals for Armor,"[Intro]
Alright, it took me three days to send you this, but
Uh, sorry, I was in a depression
But I'm trying to come out of it now


[Verse 1]
Every morning I wake up
From a dream of you, holding me

Underwater
(Is that a dream or a memory?)
Held my breath for a decade

Dyed my hair blue to match my lips

Cool of me to try (Pretty cool I'm still alive)

[Chorus]
I beat it like a dead horse, I beat it like a drum
Oh, I stayed with you too long
Skipping like a record, but I sang along
To a silly little song
I said I beat it like a dead horse, I beat it like a drum

Oh, I stayed with you too long
Skipping like a record, but I sang along
A shitty never-ending song


[Verse 2]
Sometimes it's good to be the bigger person
But I'm so small I can't compare

And after all, it's only fair, yeah
I got what I deserved, I was the other woman first
Other others on the line
But I kept trying to make it work

[Chorus]
I beat it like a dead horse, I beat it like a drum
Oh, I stayed with you too long
Skipping like a record, but I sang along
To a silly little song
I said I beat it like a dead horse, I beat it like a drum

Oh, I stayed with you too long
Skipping like a record, but I sang along
To your shitty little song


[Break]
Ya-ya-ya-ya, ya-ya-ya-ya
Ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya
Ya-ya-ya, ya-ya-ya-ya
Ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya


[Bridge]
When I said goodbye, I hope you cried
When I said goodbye, I hope you cried
When I said goodbye, I hope you cried
When I said goodbye, I hope you cried

[Chorus]
I beat it like a dead horse, I beat it like a drum
Oh, I stayed with you too long
Skipping like a record, but I sang along
To a silly little song
I said I beat it like a dead horse, I beat it like a drum

Oh, I stayed with you too long
Skipping like a record, but I sang along
And now you get another song

My Friend,Petals for Armor,"[Intro]
Mmm, ah

[Verse 1]
Little wrinkle by your eye
I never noticed 'til right now
Little vicious tiger stripes
If you get closer to my thighs

When you're walkin' with a limp
I can remember wolves at your heels
When my shadow barges in
You never question why she is here
(Eh-eh, eh-eh, eh-eh, eh-eh)

[Chorus]
My friend, when the blood has dried
My friend, instant alibi
You've seen me from every side
Still down for the ride
Ooh, my friend, you know why

[Verse 2]
Not a secret I can't keep
All of your good and your evil
Well, babe, you can leave it with me
Safe together
If it's wrong or if it's right
I am beside you, famine or fi-ire
(I-ire, i-ire, i-ire, i-ire)

[Chorus]
My friend, when the blood has dried
My friend, instant alibi
You've seen me from every side
Still down for the ride
Ooh, my friend

[Bridge]
Who could take your place?
Who could take mine?
None could take your place
None could take mine

[Chorus]
My friend, when the blood has dried
My friend (We stay safe together, we stay safe together)
Instant alibi (We stay safe together, escape death forever)
You've seen me from all sides
Still down for the ride
Ooh, my friend, you know why

[Outro]
We stay safe together
We stay safe together
We stay safe together
Escape death forever

Roses/Lotus/Violet/Iris,Petals for Armor,"[Verse 1: Hayley Williams, Hayley Williams & boygenius]
I have seen your body
And I have seen your beauty
They are separate things
Pretty, pretty, pretty things
But I am in a garden
Tending to my own
So what do I care
And what do you care if I grow?
If I grow


[Chorus: Hayley Williams, boygenius]
Roses, roses, roses, roses, roses

Hopes it won't spark envy in your irises


[Verse 2: Hayley Williams, Hayley Williams & boygenius]
Think of all the wilted women
Who crane their necks to reach a window
Ripping all their petals off just 'cause
""He loves me now, he loves me not""
I myself was a wilted woman
Drowsy in a dark room
Forgot my roots
Now watch me bloom

[Chorus: Hayley Williams, boygenius, Both]
Roses, roses, roses, roses, roses

[Bridge: Hayley Williams, Hayley Williams & boygenius]
And I will not compare
Other beauty to mine
And I will not become
A thorn in my own side

And I will not return
To where I once was
Well, I can break through the earth
Come out soft and wild

Why We Ever,Petals for Armor,"[Verse 1]
Open your mouth

Say something warm

I've spent a while
On the stranger side of your door

How do you sound?
What do you look like now?

Drawing circles on the floor
Tried to keep myself from hurting
I don't know why anymore

I won't give in to the fear
Crystal clear

[Outro: Hayley Williams & Rusty Williams]
Friends or lovers
(Clear) Won't give in to the fear
Friends or lovers, which will it be?
It's a feeling (Friends or lovers)
(Clear) I'm still right here
Friends or lovers, which will it be?"
First Thing to Go,FLOWERS for VASES / descansos,"[Verse 1]
First thing to go was the sound of his voice, ah

It echoes still, I'm sure, but I can't hear it
Was it gentle or cold? Or maybe just noise, I
Heard what I wanted until I couldn't


[Chorus]
And I'm scared to lose
Ah, what's left of you


[Verse 2]
Time moves slow, I just talk to myself, I
Finish my own sentences the way you used to (Mmm)

Why do memories glow the way real moments don't? Ah

My altar is full of all love's delusions


[Chorus]
And I, mmm
And I, mmm
And I'm scared to lose
And I (I)
What's left of you (I)
I should forget
But I love what's left


[Outro]
The first thing to go was the sound of his voice"
My Limb,FLOWERS for VASES / descansos,"[Verse 1]
If you gotta amputate, don't give me the tourniquet
You wish that I would run away, sever what isn't working
But I'll let my body bleed out
, lean into my left side

If your part of me is gone now, do I wanna survive?

[Chorus]
My limb
, my limb, my limb, my limb
My limb, my limb, my limb, my limb (Don't let go)

My limb, my limb, my limb, my limb (Let go)

My limb, my limb, my limb, my limb

[Verse 2]
Funny, of the two of us, you always were the gentle one
Shy little rabbit, teething on a shotgun

Guess we were collateral damage, kissing in the crossfire
Limpin' over dead leaves, I wish that they would cover me


[Chorus]
My limb, my limb, my limb, my limb (Don't let go)

My limb, my limb, my limb, my limb (Let go)

My limb, my limb, my limb, my limb (Don't let go)

My limb, my limb, my limb, my limb (Don't let go)


[Bridge]
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-oh)
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-oh)
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Don't, don't let go my limb
Don't, don't let go my limb (Don't let go)

[Chorus]
My limb, my limb, my limb, my limb (Don't, don't let go my limb)

My limb, my limb, my limb, my limb (Don't, don't let go my limb)

My limb, my limb, my limb, my limb (Don't, don't let go my limb)

My limb, my limb, my limb, my limb, my limb (Don't, don't let go my limb)
(Don't let go my)
(Don't let go)
(Don't let go my)"
Asystole,FLOWERS for VASES / descansos,"[Verse 1]
I don't live for you, I live for me
If only that were true
If only I could prove that, on my own, I'm worthy

Funny how it feels like
We're talking to each other on the other line

But it's quiet here
Nothin' playing but the song of asystole


[Chorus]
Asystole, asystole
Asystole, asystole


[Verse 2]
And I can't get my head
To say anything my heart could ever understand
I want to forget
But the feelin' isn't somethin' I can let myself let go of
The trouble is the way you stick
To any part of me that remains intact

But if I pull the plug
It isn't only me that I'm holding back

[Chorus]
Asystole, asystole
Asystole, asystole

[Bridge]
Revive your love in me

Revive another side of me

My eyes, to see the poisoned devotion in me
Revive, revive, revive

[Chorus]
Asystole, asystole


[Outro]
(Oh, ah)
(Oh, ah)
(Oh)
(Ooh)"
Trigger,FLOWERS for VASES / descansos,"[Verse 1]
All I ever had to say about love is a sad song
I get off on tellin' everybody what went wrong
It makes me feel like the pain had a purpose
Keeps me believin' that maybe it's worth it

Truth is, all I really want is somebody who wants me
Somebody I can count on who won't disappoint me
At first, it seems easy, I vow not to give up
Let 'em debase me while keepin' my chin up

[Chorus]
'Cause I got the trigger, but you hold the gun
How come you never put the safety on?
I got the trigger, but you hold the gun
How come you never put the safety on? Mmm


[Verse 2]
So, what do people sing about once they finally found it?
Take it for granted, think of how they were better without it?
I'd like to imagine I'd never be like that
But if I'm honest, I know I already have


[Chorus]
'Cause I got the trigger, but you hold the gun
How come you never put the safety on?
I got the trigger, but you hold the gun
How come you never put the safety on? Mmm

[Bridge]
Mmm

[Chorus]
I got the trigger, but you own the gun

How come you never put the safety on?
Yeah, I got the trigger, but you hold the gun
How come you never put the safety on? Mmm"
Over Those Hills,FLOWERS for VASES / descansos,"[Verse 1]
Over those hills, I bet you're somewhere dreaming
I take my pills every night and in the morning

When you wake up, ever wish I was beside you?
We could look out together in those hills forever

[Verse 2]
Over those hills, I bet you're somewhere dreaming
I take my pills every night and in the morning

When you wake up (Wake up, wish I was), ever wish I was beside you? (Beside, beside you)

We could look out together in those hills forever, hmm

[Verse 3]
So this is the feeling
You can't imagine that it's real
'Til you feel it, oh
Almost went numb
Thought I'd had enough
But the hurt is half the fun


[Break]
Da, da-ra-ra, da-ra-ra, da-ra-ra-ra, da, da-ra-ra, da-ra, da-ra-ra
Da, da-ra-ra, da-ra-ra, da-ra-ra-ra, da

[Outro]
We could look out together on those hills forever"
Good Grief,FLOWERS for VASES / descansos,"[Verse 1]
There's no such thing as good grief

Haven't eaten in three weeks
Skin and bones when you're not near me
I'm all skeleton and melody


[Verse 2]
There's no such thing as good grief
Sleep with you in a sex dream
And I'm pretty sure you don't miss the way
I put all my demons on display to your pretty music


[Chorus]
One more time, play me something, I won't sing
I'll be quiet, play me something
One more time, I'm listening


[Verse 3]
There's no such thing as good grief
Took two months to pack up your things

But I left a box at your parents' house

Don't know whether to feel sad or proud


[Chorus]
One more time, play me something, I won't sing
I'll be quiet, play me something
One more time, I'm listening"
Wait On,FLOWERS for VASES / descansos,"[Verse 1]
I don't wanna wait on you
But it's just what I keep doing
As if I got nothing to do
As if my life won't keep on going without you


[Chorus]
The sky will wake up every morning
And sometimes feel the need to pour out
All the feelings it's been holding
But either way, it never comes down
It knows its place and knows a way around the clouds
And their design


[Verse 2]
For every fairytale untrue
And all the hearts yet to be broken

For every bird who never flew
Well, it's a wonder we keep going without you

[Chorus]
The sky still wakes up every morning
And sometimes feels the need to pour out
Everything it's tired of holding
But either way, it never comes down
It's gonna stay and find a way around the clouds

[Outro]
There was a bird who never flew
But she still kept all of her feathers
So she could pluck 'em out for you
And you could wear them in your hair and
She'd be with you"

[Verse 1]
Keep you right here
Where the line is
At my fingers
On the surface

Keep you right here
Where the line is
Keep you right here

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Keep you right here (Keep you right here)
Where the line is

Ooh
Oh-oh, mmm"
Inordinary,FLOWERS for VASES / descansos,"[Verse 1]
I don't want your concern
As some consolation prize
And I don't want to be your friend

Or just one of the guys

I am nobody's
We left home when we were teens
I grew bored of simple things

You gave me another chance
A renegade holdin' your hand

I was somebody's

[Chorus]
I wasn't ordinary, ordinary, ordinary
I was inordinary, ordinary
I wasn't ordinary, ordinary, ordinary
I was inordinary, ordinary

[Verse 2]
Life began in seventh grade
When me and mama got away
Came home from school one afternoon
She was waitin' in the car for me
She said, ""Don't worry""

Started over, Tennessee
Rent was cheap and we were free
I wish that feelin' stuck around

There's a beauty to be found

Mmm

[Chorus]
In the ordinary, ordinary, ordinary

In the ordinary, ordinary
In the ordinary, ordinary, ordinary
In the ordinary, ordinary

[Outro]
(I was inordinary, ordinary)
(I wasn't ordinary, ordinary, ordinary)"
HYD,FLOWERS for VASES / descansos,"[Intro]
When the air is quiet and the sky is blue

I can't help be reminded of yo - 
Are you
fucking kidding me?

[Verse 1]
When the air is quiet and the sky is blue
I can't help be reminded of you

How your eyes are shut so you cannot see
Just how very close I keep you to me

And in that dark little place you have made
You'd swear all these pretty clouds are gray


[Chorus]
I wonder how you're doing
How you're doing now


[Verse 2]
In a million years, never thought I'd see
The day you would choose your fear over me
'Cause many storms have come and if not for you
I'd have been struck down, disappeared at sea

I know it's hard for you to take a compliment
But my life began the day which you came in it


[Chorus]
I wonder how you view me
How you view me now

[Verse 3]
On a night like this, it's just me and the kid
And there's a chair for you where you'd always sit

And we would talk for hours about the dumbest shit
And you would always start my cigarette

[Outro]
I wonder if you ever quit like you wanted

I bet you did, I bet you did
I bet you did, I bet you did

How you doing?"
No Use I Just Do,FLOWERS for VASES / descansos,"[Verse 1]
Nobody wants to be alone
But that is not why I want you

See, I've tried and I keep trying, but baby

[Chorus]
It's no use, it's no use, I just love you
It's no use, I just love you
It's no use, I just love you
It's no use, I just love you

[Verse 2]
If I just wanted someone to hold
Then really, anyone would do

I close my eyes and really try
Not to turn 'em into you


[Chorus]
It's no use, I just love you
It's no use, I just love you
It's no use, I just love you
It's no use, I just love you
It's no use, I just do


[Outro]
It's no use, I just love you, mmm
It's no use, I just love you
It's no use, I just love you, mmm
It's no use, I just love you
It's no use, I just love you
Mmm
It's no use, I just love you
It's no use, I just love you
It's no use, I just love you
It's no use, I just love you"
Find Me Here,FLOWERS for VASES / descansos,"[Verse 1]
No one can hold your hand
Now through the delicate darkness you go
If I trespass even one step
It all just disappears, clock starts over


[Chorus]
As long as I am loving you, you'll never be alone
As long as you keep wanting me around
But this is one trip you're gonna have to take alone
When you come back, you'll find me here where I belong

[Interlude]
Hmm, hmm
La, la, la, la, hmm, hmm

[Verse 2]
Soft like sand, sift through your hands
Memories we both agree are not reality


[Chorus]
As long as you are loving me, I know I'm not alone
Even if you're nowhere to be found
Sometimes life takes you back to places you run from
I'll be right here if ever you come home"
Just a Lover,FLOWERS for VASES / descansos,"[Intro]
Love is not a friend, it's not a brother

Love is not a Wendy-Moira-mother

Love has turned me into many others
, now I guess I'm just

[Break]
Just a lover

[Verse 1]
Once upon a time when we were school kids
Mix CDs and carpool kids

No little cameras to witness

Really hope we don't wreck this

When you're coming over

[Break]
Just a lover

[Verse 2]
Space and time, waking hours before I open my eyes

In the morning, I feel my heart crack open, one last chorus
Space and time, waking hours before I open my eyes
In the morning, I feel my heart crack open, one last chorus
I'll be singing into empty glasses
No more music for the masses

One more hour, one more ugly, stillborn cry

I know exactly what this is
Or whatever it was, or whatever it was"
