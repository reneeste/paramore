All We Know,All We Know Is Falling,"[Verse 1]
We've tried so hard to understand
But we can't
We held the world out in our hands
And you ran away

It takes some time to let you go
And it shows

[Chorus]
'Cause all we know
Is falling, it falls
And remember
'Cause I know that we won't forget at all


[Verse 2]
Now we could follow you back home
But we won't

Is this what you had waited for?

Just to be alone?

It takes some time to let you go
And it shows

[Chorus]
'Cause all we know
Is falling, it falls
And remember
'Cause I know that we won't forget at all

[Bridge]
You never
You never said
This wasn't what you wanted
Was it? Was it?
This isn't what you wanted
This isn't what you wanted

[Chorus]
'Cause all we know
Is falling, it falls
Remember
'Cause I know that we won't forget at all"
Pressure,All We Know Is Falling,"[Verse 1]
Tell me where our time went
And if it was time well spent
Just don't let me fall asleep
Feeling empty again

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I fear I might break
And I fear I can't take it
Tonight, I'll lie awake
Feeling empty

[Chorus]
I can feel the pressure
It's getting closer now
We're better off without you
I can feel the pressure
It's getting closer now
We're better off without you

[Verse 2]
Now that I'm losing hope
And there's nothing else to show
For all of the days that we spent
Carried away from home

[Pre-Chorus]
Some things, I'll never know
And I had to let them go
I'm sitting all alone
Feeling empty


[Chorus]
I can feel the pressure
It's getting closer now
We're better off without you
I can feel the pressure
It's getting closer now
We're better off without you

[Post-Chorus]
(Without you)

[Bridge]
Some things, I'll never know
And I had to let them go
Some things, I'll never know
And I had to let them go
Well, I'm sitting all alone
Feeling empty

[Chorus]
I can feel the pressure
It's getting closer now
We're better off without you
Feel the pressure
It's getting closer now
You're better off without me"
Emergency,All We Know Is Falling,"[Verse 1]
I think we have an emergency
I think we have an emergency

If you thought I'd leave, then you were wrong
'Cause I won't stop holding on
So are you listening?
So are you watchin' me?
If you thought I'd leave, then you were wrong
'Cause I won't stop holding on
This is an emergency
So are you listening?
And I can't pretend
That I don't see this


[Pre-Chorus]
But it's really not your fault
That no one cares to talk about it
To talk about it


[Chorus]
'Cause I've seen love die
Way too many times
When it deserved to be alive
(When it deserved to be alive)
And I've seen you cry
Way too many times
When you deserved to be alive
Alive

[Verse 2]
So you give up every chance you get
Just to feel new again
I think we have an emergency
I think we have an emergency

And you do your best to show me love
But you don't know what love is

So are you listening?
So are you watchin' me?
Well, I can't pretend
That I don't see this


[Pre-Chorus]
But it's really not your fault
That no one cares to talk about it
To talk about it


[Chorus]
'Cause I've seen love die
Way too many times
When it deserved to be alive
(When it deserved to be alive)
And I've seen you cry
Way too many times
When you deserved to be alive
Alive

[Bridge]
These scars, they will not
Fade away


[Breakdown]
No one cares to talk about it
To talk about it


[Chorus]
'Cause I've seen love die
Way too many times
When it deserved to be alive
(When it deserved to be alive)
And I've seen you cry
Way too many times
When you deserved to be alive
Alive"
Brighter,All We Know Is Falling,"[Verse 1]
So this is how it goes
Well, I, I would have never known
And if it ends today
Well, I'll still say that you shine brighter than anyone


[Chorus]
Now I think we're taking this too far
Don't you know that
It's not this hard?
Well, it's not this hard
But if you take what's yours and I take mine
Must we go there?
Please, not this time
No, not this time

[Verse 2]
Well, this is not your fault
But if I'm without you, then I will feel so small
And if you have to go
Well, always know that you shine brighter than anyone does

[Chorus]
Now I think we're taking this too far
Don't you know that
It's not this hard?
Well, it's not this hard
But if you take what's yours and I take mine
Must we go there?
Please, not this time
No, not this time

[Bridge]
If you run away now
Will you come back around?

[Verse 3]
And if you ran away
I'd still wave goodbye, watching you shine bright


[Chorus]
Now I think we're taking this too far
Don't you know that
It's not this hard?
Well, it's not this hard
But if you take what's yours and I take mine
Must we go there?
Please, not this time
No, not this time

[Outro]
And I'll wave goodbye (You shine bright)
Watching you shine bright (You shine bright)
And I'll wave goodbye (You shine bright)
Tonight"
Here We Go Again,All We Know Is Falling,"[Verse 1]
And here we go again with all the things we said
And not a minute spent to think that we'd regret
So we just take it back, these words and hold our breath
Forget the things we swore we meant


[Chorus]
I'll write you just to let you know
That I'm alright
Can't say I'm sad to see you go
'Cause I'm not (No, I'm not)
Well, I'm not


[Verse 2]
And here we go again with all the things we did
And now I'm wondering just who would I have been
To be the one attached at all times to your hip
Forget the things we swore we meant

[Chorus]
I'll write you just to let you know
That I'm alright
Can't say I'm sad to see you go
'Cause I'm not (No, I'm not)
Well, I'm not (No, I'm not)
Oh (No, I'm not)

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
I'll write you to let you know

'Cause I'm not (No, I'm not)
Well, I'm not (No, I'm not)
I'm not
I'm not

I'm not (So we just take it back, so we just take it back)
(So we just take it back, so we just take it back)
I'm not (So we just take it back, so we just take it back)
(So we just take it back)"
Never Let This Go,All We Know Is Falling,"[Verse 1]
Maybe if my heart stops beating, it won't hurt this much
And never will I have to answer again to anyone


[Pre-Chorus]
Please don't get me wrong
Because

[Chorus]
I'll never let this go
But I can't find the words to tell you
I don't wanna be alone (Don't wanna be alone)
But now I feel like I don't know you, oh


[Verse 2]
One day, you'll get sick of saying that everything's alright
And by then, I'm sure I'll be pretending just like I am tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
Please don't get me wrong
Because

[Chorus]
I'll never let this go
But I can't find the words to tell you
I don't wanna be alone (Don't wanna be alone)
But now I feel like I don't know you

[Bridge]
Let this go
Let this go

[Chorus]
But I'll never let this go
But I can't find the words to tell you

And I'll never let this go (Never let this go)
But I can't find the words to tell you
That now I feel like I don't know you"
Whoa,All We Know Is Falling,"[Verse 1]
I've hoped for change and it gets better every day
I've hoped for change, but still, I feel the same

[Pre-Chorus]
There's something wrong 'cause everybody knows
That we can do this on our own

[Chorus]
And we've got everybody singin'
Woah, woah, woah, woah
We've got everybody singin'
Woah, woah, woah, woah

Conspiracy,All We Know Is Falling,"[Verse 1]
Please speak softly for they will hear us

And they'll find out why we don't trust them
Speak up, dear, 'cause I cannot hear you
I need to know why we don't trust them


[Chorus]
Explain to me this conspiracy against me

Yeah, yeah
And tell me how I've lost my power

Oh, yeah

[Verse 2]
Where can I turn? 'Cause I need something more
Surrounded by uncertainty, I'm so unsure
Tell me why I feel so alone
'Cause I need to know to whom do I owe

[Chorus]
Explain to me this conspiracy against me
Yeah, yeah
And tell me how I've lost my power
Oh, yeah

[Bridge]
I thought that we'd make it
Because you said that we'd make it through
And when all security fails, will you be there
To help me through?

[Chorus]
Explain to me this conspiracy against me
Yeah, yeah
And tell me how I've lost my power
Oh

[Outro]
I've lost my power"
Franklin,All We Know Is Falling,"[Verse 1: Hayley Williams]
And when we get home
I know we won't be home at all
This place we live
It is not where we belong
And I miss who we were
In the town that we could call our own
Going back to get away
After everything has changed

[Chorus: Josh Farro, Hayley Williams]
Could you remind me of a time
When we were so alive? (Everything has changed)
Do you remember that?
Do you remember that? (Everything has changed)
Could you help me push aside
All that I have left behind? (Everything is changed)
Do you remember that?
Do you remember that?


[Verse 2: Hayley Williams]
So we stand here now
And no one knows us at all
I won't get used to this
I won't get used to being gone

And going back won't feel the same
If we aren't staying
Going back to get away
After everything has changed

[Chorus: Josh Farro, Hayley Williams]
Could you remind me of a time
When we were so alive? (Everything has changed)
Do you remember that?
Do you remember that? (Everything has changed)
Could you help me push aside
All that I have left behind? (Everything is changed)
Do you remember that?
Do you remember that?

[Bridge: Hayley Williams]
It's taking up our time, we can't
Go back, we can't go back at all
It's taking up our time, we can't
Go back, we can't go back at all
It's taking up our time, we can't
Go back, we can't go back at all
It's taking up our time
Taking up our time


[Outro: Josh Farro, Hayley Williams & Josh Farro]
'Cause you remind me of a time
When we were so alive
Do you remember that?
Do you remember that?"
My Heart,All We Know Is Falling,"[Verse 1]
I am finding out
Then, maybe, I was wrong
That I've fallen down
And I can't do this alone


[Pre-Chorus]
Stay with me
This is what I need, please


[Chorus]
Sing us a song
And we'll sing it back to you
We could sing our own
But what would it be without you? Oh

I am nothing now
And it's been so long
Since I've heard a sound
The sound of my only hope


[Pre-Chorus]
This time
I will be listening

And we'll sing it back to you (Sing it back to you)

"For a Pessimist, I'm Pretty Optimistic",Riot!,"[Verse 1]
Just talk yourself up and tear yourself down
You've hit your one wall, now find a way around

Well, what's the problem? You got a lot of nerve


[Pre-Chorus]
So what did you think I would say?
No, you can't run away
No, you can't run away
So what did you think I would say?
No, you can't run away
No, you can't run away
You wouldn't

[Chorus]
I never wanted to say this
You never wanted to stay
I put my faith in you, so much faith
And then you just threw it away
You threw it away

I'm not so naive, my sorry eyes can see
The way you fight shy of almost everything
Well, if you give up, you'll get what you deserve

No, you can't run away
No, you can't run away
So what did you think I would say?

You were finished long before
We had even seen the start

Why don't you stand up? Be a man about it
Fight with your bare hands about it now

[Chorus]
I never wanted to say this (Say this)
You never wanted to stay, well, did you?
I put my faith in you, so much faith
And then you just threw it away
I never wanted to say this
You never wanted to stay
And I put my faith in you, so much faith
And then you just threw it away"
That's What You Get,Riot!,"[Verse 1]
No, sir
Well, I don't wanna be the blame, not anymore
It's your turn
So take a seat, we're settling the final score
And why do we like to hurt so much?

I can't decide
You have made it harder just to go on
And why?
All the possibilities, well, I was wrong

[Chorus]
That's what you get when you let your heart win

Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
That's what you get when you let your heart win
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
I drowned out all my sense with the sound of its beating
And that's what you get when you let your heart win
Whoa-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
I wonder
How am I supposed to feel when you're not here?
'Cause I burned
Every bridge I ever built when you were here

I still try
Holding onto silly things, I never learn
Oh, why?

All the possibilities, I'm sure you've heard

[Chorus]
That's what you get when you let your heart win
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
That's what you get when you let your heart win
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
I drowned out all my sense with the sound of its beating (Beating)
And that's what you get when you let your heart win
Whoa-oh-oh-oh

[Bridge]
Pain, make your way to me, to me
And I'll always be just so (So) inviting
If I ever start to think straight
This heart will start a riot in me
Let's start, start, hey

[Refrain: Hayley Williams, Hayley Williams, Josh Farro, Zac Farro, Jeremy Davis & Steve Smith]
Why do we like to hurt so much?

That's what you get when you let your heart win
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
That's what you get when you let your heart win
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Now I can't trust myself with anything but this
And that's what you get when you let your heart win

Hallelujah,Riot!,"[Verse 1]
Somehow everything's gonna fall right into place
If we only had a way to make it all fall faster every day
If only time flew like a dove
Well, God, make it fly faster than I'm falling in love

[Chorus]
This time, we're not giving up
Let's make it last forever
Screaming, ""Hallelujah""
We'll make it last forever

Holding on to patience wearing thin
I can't force these eyes to see the end
If only time flew like a dove
Well, we could watch it fly and just keep looking up

This time, we're not giving up
Let's make it last forever
Screaming, ""Hallelujah""
We'll make it last forever

Misery Business,Riot!,"[Intro]

Hit that, hit that snare


[Verse 1]
I'm in the business of misery
, let's take it from the top
She's got a body like an hourglass, it's ticking like a clock

It's a matter of time before we all run out

When I thought he was mine, she caught him by the mouth
I waited eight long months, she finally set him free
I told him I couldn't lie, he was the only one for me
Two weeks and we caught on fire
She's got it out for me, but I wear the biggest smile

[Chorus]
Woah, I never meant to brag
But I got him where I want him now
Woah, it was never my intention to brag
To steal it all away from you now
But God, does it feel so good
'Cause I got him where I want him now

And if you could, then you know you would
'Cause God, it just feels so
It just feels so good

[Verse 2]
Second chances, they don't ever matter, people never change
Once a whore, you're nothing more, I'm sorry, that'll never change

And about forgiveness, we're both supposed to have exchanged
I'm sorry, honey, but I passed it up, now look this way
Well, there's a million other girls who do it just like you
Looking as innocent as possible to get to who
They want and what they like, it's easy if you do it right

Well, I refuse, I refuse, I refuse

[Chorus]
Woah, I never meant to brag
But I got him where I want him now
Woah, it was never my intention to brag
To steal it all away from you now
But God, does it feel so good
'Cause I got him where I want him right now

And if you could, then you know you would
'Cause God, it just feels so
It just feels so good


[Bridge]
I watched his wildest dreams come true
And not one of them involving you
Just watch my wildest dreams come true
Not one of them involving

[Guitar Solo]

[Refrain]
Woah, I never meant to brag
But I got him where I want him now

[Chorus]
Woah, I never meant to brag
But I got him where I want him now
Woah, it was never my intention to brag
To steal it all away from you now
But God, does it feel so good
'Cause I got him where I want him now

And if you could, then you know you would
'Cause God, it just feels so
It just feels so good"
When It Rains,Riot!,"[Verse 1]
And when it rains
On this side of town it touches
Everything
Just say it again and mean it
We don't miss a thing


[Pre-Chorus 1]
You made yourself a bed at the bottom of the blackest hole (Blackest hole)
And convinced yourself that it's not the reason you don't see the sun anymore


[Chorus]
And oh, oh, how could you do it?
Oh, I, I never saw it coming
Oh, oh, I need an ending
So why can't you stay just long enough to explain?


[Verse 2]
And when it rains
Well, you always find an escape
Just running away
From all of the ones who love you
From everything


[Pre-Chorus 2]
You made yourself a bed at the bottom of the blackest hole (Blackest hole)

And you'll sleep 'til May and you'll say that you don't wanna see the sun anymore

[Chorus]
And oh, oh, how could you do it?
Oh, I, I never saw it coming
Oh, oh, I need an ending
So why can't you stay just long enough to explain?

Take your time
Take my time

Take these chances to turn it around (Take your time)
Just take these chances, we'll make it somehow
And take these chances to turn it around (Take my)
Just turn it around

Oh, how could you do it?
Oh, I, I never saw it coming

Oh, oh, how could you do it?
Oh, I, I never saw it coming

Let the Flames Begin,Riot!,"[Verse 1]
What a shame we all became
Such fragile, broken things

A memory remains
Just a tiny spark

I give it all my oxygen
To let the flames begin
So let the flames begin

Oh, glory
Oh, glory

[Chorus]
This is how we'll dance when
When they try to take us down
This is what we'll be, oh, glory


[Verse 2]
Somewhere weakness is our strength
And I'll die searching for it

I can't let myself regret
Such selfishness
My pain and oh, the trouble caused
No matter how long
I believe that there's hope
Buried beneath it all and
Hiding beneath it all and
Growing beneath it all and

[Chorus]
This is how we'll dance when
When they try to take us down

This is how we'll sing, oh
This is how we'll stand when
When they burn our houses down
This is what we'll be, oh, glory

Reaching as I sink down into light (Into light)
Reaching as I sink down into light (Into light)

This is how we'll dance when
When they try to take us down

This is how we'll sing, oh
This is how we'll stand when
When they burn our houses down
This is what we'll be, oh, glory"
Miracle,Riot!,"[Verse 1]
I've gone for too long
Living like I'm not alive
So I'm gonna start over tonight

Beginning with you and I
When this memory fades
I'm gonna make sure it's replaced
With chances taken, hope embraced
And have I told you?

[Chorus]
I'm not going
'Cause I've been waiting for a miracle
And I'm not leaving

I won't let you
Let you give up on a miracle
When it might save you

[Verse 2]
We've learned to run from
Anything uncomfortable

We've tied our pain below
And no one ever has to know
That inside we're broken
I try to patch things up again
To count my tears and kill these fears
But have I told you, have I?

I'm not going
'Cause I've been waiting for a miracle
And I'm not leaving

I won't let you
Let you give up on a miracle
When it might save you

Will get it right this time (This time)

Will get it right this time
It's not faith if you're using your eyes, oh, I

I've gone for too long
Living like I'm not alive
So I'm gonna start over tonight
Beginning with you and
I don't want to run from
Anything uncomfortable
I just want, no
I just need this pain to end right here

'Cause I've been waiting for a miracle
And I'm not leaving

Let you give up on a miracle

Well, come on, come on, let's play

'Cause I'd rather waste my life pretending

Nothing compares to
A quiet evening alone
Just the one two of us who's counting on

That never happens
I guess I'm dreaming again
Let's be more than, no-ooh-oh

We Are Broken,Riot!,"[Verse 1]
I am outside and I've been waiting for the sun
With my wide eyes,
I've seen worlds that don't belong
My mouth is dry with words I cannot verbalize
Tell me why we live like this


[Pre-Chorus]
Keep me safe inside
Your arms like towers
Tower over me
, yeah

[Chorus]
'Cause we are broken
What must we do to restore our innocence
And all the promise we adored?

Give us life again

'Cause we just wanna be whole


[Verse 2]
Lock the doors 'cause I'd like to capture this voice
It came to me tonight
So everyone will have a choice
And under red lights, I'll show myself it wasn't forged

We're at war, we live like this

Keep me safe inside
Your arms like towers
Tower over me

'Cause we are broken
What must we do to restore our innocence
And all the promise we adored?

Fences,Riot!,"[Verse 1]
I'm sitting in a room
Made up of only big white walls

And in the hall
There are people looking through
The window in the door
They know exactly what we're here for
Don't look up, just let them think
There's no place else you'd rather be
You're always on display
For everyone to watch and learn from
Don't you know by now?


[Pre-Chorus]
You can't turn back
Because this road is all you'll ever have


[Chorus]
And it's obvious that you're dying, dying
Just living proof that the camera's lying

And oh, oh, open wide
'Cause this is your night so smile

'Cause you'll go out in style
You'll go out in style


[Verse 2]
If you let me, I could
I'd show you how to build your fences, set restrictions
Separate from the world

The constant battle that you hate to fight
Just blame the limelight
Don't look up, just let them think
There's no place else you'd rather be

[Pre-Chorus]
And now you can't turn back
Because this road is all you'll ever have

And it's obvious that you're dying, dying
Just living proof that the camera's lying

And oh, oh, open wide
'Cause this is your night so smile


[Bridge]
Yeah, yeah, you're asking for it
With every breath that you breathe in

Just breathe it in
Yeah, yeah, well, you're just a mess
You do all this big talking
So now let's see you walk it
I said let's see you walk it
Yeah, yeah, well, you're just a mess
You do all this big talking
So now let's see you walk it
I said let's see you walk it

Born for This,Riot!,"[Verse 1: Hayley Williams & Backing Vocalists]
Oh no, I just keep on falling
Back to the same old

And where's hope when misery comes crawling?

Oh, my way-ay
With your faith, you'll trigger a landslide

And kill off this common sense of mine

And it takes acquired minds
To taste, to taste, to taste this wine

Right now, you're the only reason
I'm not letting go, oh

And I can't keep my heart from singing
Along to the sound of your song

To this 4/4 beat, I would die for you (Die for you)

Rewind (Demo),RIOT! (International Deluxe Version),"[Verse 1]
Don't come looking for me
'Cause I'll be right here with the words you said
Looking for the words that you say
You know what you did, you know
And how can anybody forget the promise that you made?
'Cause this is how a promise breaks
I always knew you'd fall through
And now you're proof

[Chorus]
Rewind to the first time
That I felt it coming
I knew it would not last
Rewind to the first time
That I felt it coming
Make it quick, make it painless

And now you're running from me
So cool, so scared of what you might have said

And no one's ever looked away
'Cause we know what you did, we know

If I told anybody, that we would soon forget your name
And you would never have a place

I always knew you'd fall through
And now you're proof

That I felt it coming
I knew it would not last
Rewind to the first time
That I felt it coming
Make it quick, make it painless

Please don't say too much, oh-oh
I think we've heard enough from you, oh

Decoy,The B-Sides,"[Verse 1]
Close your eyes and make believe
This is where you wanna be

Forgetting all the memories, try to forget love 'cause love's forgotten me
Well, hey, hey baby, it's never too late
Pretty soon, you won't remember a thing
And I'll be distant, the stars reminiscing
Your heart's been wasted on me

[Chorus]
You've never been so used as I'm using you, abusing you

My little decoy
Don't look so blue, you should've seen right through

I'm using you, my little decoy
My little decoy

Live your life inside a dream
Time is changing everything
Forgetting all the memories
And I'm forced into you just 'cause you're into me

Well hey, hey baby, it's never too late
When I'm gone you won't remember a thing
But I can't stay and you know I won't wait
I was gone from the very first day

You've never been so used as I'm using you, abusing you
My little decoy
Don't look so blue, you should've seen right through
I'm using you, my little decoy

Another Day,The B-Sides,"[Verse 1]
And if you're listening, I miss you
And if you hear me now, I need you
Where did you go? 'Cause you're not gone
Everyone knows that something's wrong
The wires were cut and I'm alone

I know we're getting closer
I know you're coming back for me this time, this time

And do you ever want me? Do you ever need me?

And anytime you want me, anytime you see me
I don't think you meant to say goodbye
But it's okay, there's always another day

Your voice comes in and now it's fading
I can't believe this is so frustrating
'Cause you never seem to understand
And you let me slip straight through your hands
And how does it feel to be alone?

I know we're getting closer
I know you're coming back for me this time, this time

Just Like Me,The B-Sides,"[Verse 1]
I slipped down the stairs
Tripped over your fragile ego
I slid down the hallway
Right into the web you'd woven

And you never said
That you meant to save someone
Somebody just like me
And you never told me
You wanted to love someone
Somebody just like me

You felt it was safer that way
You put up a wall
And now your whole world is caving in

And you never said
That you meant to save someone
Somebody just like me
And you never told me
You wanted to love someone
Somebody just like me

Counting stars to name your lies

You let the rain push you away
And now you're drowning in the waves

Somebody just like me
And you never told me
You wanted to love someone
Somebody just like me

Adore,The B-Sides,"[Verse 1]

Maybe we're too young and I don't even know what's real

I've never wanted anything so bad
I've never wanted anyone so bad

And I don't wanna let this go

Really, I just want to know

There's an empty room at the end of the hall
And it's begging to swallow you whole

[Pre-Chorus]
Each step you take
Makes it easier to fall on your face
Each tear you fake
Makes it easier to see straight through you now

[Chorus]
And you're so hateful sometimes
Throwing punches at lies
Far from somewhere above
Just to say you're in love

So you hang yourself from stolen dreams

And under the table, you hide every stain

Each step you take (Getting closer)
Makes it easier to fall on your face
Each death you fake (Getting closer)
Makes it easier to live this way, hey, now

Swim In Silence,The B-Sides,"[Verse 1]
Meet me here beneath the burning skies
Where the ocean comes and takes us from all of our lives
You never said that you were coming back
I have waited although I have found the place you hide

[Pre-Chorus]
What keeps you so far away?

[Chorus]
We can swim in silence
You can pull me under
I will not come up for anyone
I can slowly sink and
Watch you as you're leaving
I will drown until you care

[Post-Chorus]
I will drown until you care

I imagine what it must be like
To have everything you need and not be satisfied (Not be satisfied)
Run the water 'til it burns
And you can't see through the waves that crash into your pride

What keeps you so far away?

We can swim in silence
You can pull me under
I will not come up for anyone

Getting close to what we cannot recognize
Floating face down in the lies
Here we are without a trace
But the lies we used to blame
And you're so far away
What keeps you so far away?

We can swim in silence
You can pull me under
And I will not come up for anyone
And I can slowly sink and
Watch you as you're leaving

Your lies are bleeding through your teeth
Your eyes, the only one thing in me
Your promises never really meant a thing
But they float from your lips so easily

Stay, stay, stay, stay away
Stay, stay, stay, stay away from me
Stay, stay, stay, stay away, away

The glass that rips your word apart
Is it the guilt that keeps you up at night when you're in bed?
Well, you can sleep sound, honey, I'll write you a check, oh

Stay, stay, stay, stay, stay away from me
Stay, stay, stay, stay away
Stay, stay, stay, stay away from me
Stay, stay, stay, stay away, away

You made it easy when your glee presided
With all the evil that you've provided
You still put the ""good"" in ""goodbye""
In goodbye

Stay, stay, stay, stay, stay away from me
Stay, stay, stay, stay away from me
Stay, stay, stay, stay, stay away from me"
Temporary (Demo),The B-Sides,"[Verse 1]
I used to be so quick, so clever
I used to know myself much better
Anyone can see that this is only permanent
Temporary, it never hurts to try

[Chorus]
And it's all a game
I know we'll stay the same
But repetition ends in failure
And every time I see it in your eyes
When repetition ends, we'll start over

[Verse 2]
Now I'm a walking contradiction
So tell me what's wrong with this picture
Cause anyone can see that this is only permanent
Temporary, so don't hurt me this time

[Chorus]
And it's all a game
I know we'll stay the same
But repetition ends in failure
And every time I see it in your eyes
When repetition ends, we'll start over

[Bridge]
So give it up, just give up
Give it up, give up
So give it up, just give up
Give it up, give up

[Chorus]
And it's all a game
I know we'll stay the same
But repetition ends in failure
And every time I see it in your eyes
When repetition ends, we'll start over

[Outro]
We'll start over"
Teenagers,The B-Sides,"[Verse 1]
I'm gonna go on living like I never met you
And it'll feel wrong at first, but I think I can forget you

Ignore the fact that we sleep no more than three feet apart
I feel you now, you're all around me, underneath me
You're all around me, underneath me


[Chorus]
Well, how was I to know that what we carved in stone
Would be so temporary?

Well, how was I to know that my first crack in love
Would not be the last? It won't be the last


[Verse 2]
It's in the air now, bitter tears and broken hearts

We're teenagers, we count the years
, we think we're smart
But we're not, we don't know anything


[Chorus]
So don't ask me where I'll go 'cause, frankly, I don't know
And I don't give a shit
(Ah)
Why must we all make sense of what just won't make sense?

For once, I'm just gonna live, I'm just gonna live


[Bridge]
We're teenagers, we don't know anything
We're teenagers, we don't know anything

Oh

[Chorus]
Well, how was I to know that what we carved in stone
Would be so temporary?
(I'm gonna go on)
Why must we all make sense of what just won't make sense?

For once, I'm just gonna live, I'm just gonna live"

You're pushin' and pullin' me
Down to you

But I don't know what I -

Now when I caught myself
I had to stop myself
From saying something that
I should've never thought

You got it, you got it
Some kind of magic
Hypnotic, hypnotic
You're leaving me breathless

You're not the one I believe in
With God as my witness

Decode,Decode / I Caught Myself,"[Verse 1]
How can I decide what's right
When you're clouding up my mind?

I can't win your losing fight
All the time
Nor can I ever own what's mine
When you're always taking sides
But you won't take away my pride


[Pre-Chorus]
No, not this time
Not this time

[Chorus]
How did we get here
When I used to know you so well?
But how did we get here?
Well, I think I know

[Verse 2]
The truth is hiding in your eyes

And it's hanging on your tongue
Just boiling in my blood

But you think that I can't see
What kind of man that you are

If you're a man at all

Well, I will figure this one out

[Pre-Chorus]
On my own (I'm screaming, ""I love you so"")
On my own (But my thoughts, you can't decode)


[Chorus]
But how did we get here
When I used to know you so well? Yeah
How did we get here?
Well, I think I know

Careful,brand new eyes,"[Verse 1]
I settled down a twisted-up frown
Disguised as a smile
, well
You would've never known
I had it all, but not what I wanted
'Cause hope, for me, was a place uncharted
And overgrown

[Pre-Chorus]
You'd make your way in
I'd resist you just like this
You can't tell me to feel
The truth never set me free so I did it myself


[Chorus]

You can't be too careful anymore
When all that is waiting for you
Won't come any closer
You've got to reach out
A little more, more

More, more, more


[Verse 2]
Open your eyes like I opened mine
It's only the real world
A life you will never know
Shifting your weight to throw off the pain
Well, you can ignore it
But only for so long

[Pre-Chorus]
You look like I did
You resist me just like this

You can't tell me to heal

And it hurts remembering how it felt to shut down


[Chorus]

Can't be too careful anymore
When all that is waiting for you
Won't come any closer
You've got to reach out
A little more, more

More, more, more


[Bridge]
The truth never set me free
The truth never set me free
The truth never set me free so I'll do it myself

You can't be too careful anymore
When all that is waiting for you
Won't come any closer
You've got to reach out

Can't be too careful anymore
When all that is waiting for you
Won't come any closer
You've got to reach out

Ignorance,brand new eyes,"[Verse 1]
If I'm a bad person, you don't like me
Well, I guess I'll make my own way
It's a circle, a mean cycle
I can't excite you anymore

Where's your gavel? Your jury?
What's my offense this time?
You're not a judge, but if you're gonna judge me
Oh, sentence me to another life

Don't wanna hear your sad songs, I don't wanna feel your pain

When you swear it's all my fault
'cause you know we're not the same (No)
We're not the same (Oh)

Yeah, the friends who stuck together, we wrote our names in blood
But I guess you can't accept that the change is good (Hey)
It's good (Hey)
It's good

Well, you treat me just like another stranger
Well, it's nice to meet you, sir, I guess I'll go

I best be on my way out

Ignorance is your new best friend
Ignorance is your new best friend


[Verse 2]
This is the best thing that could've happened
Any longer and I wouldn't have made it

It's not a war, no, it's not a rapture
I'm just a person, but you can't take it
The same tricks that, that once fooled me
They won't get you anywhere
I'm not the same kid from your memory
Well, now I can fend for myself

Playing God,brand new eyes,"[Verse 1]
I can't make my own decisions
Or make any with precision
Well, maybe you should tie me up
So I don't go where you don't want me

You say that I've been changing
That I'm not just simply aging
Yeah, how could that be logical?
Just keep on cramming ideas down my throat


[Pre-Chorus]
Woah

[Chorus]
You don't have to believe me
But the way I, way I see it
Next time you point a finger
I might have to bend it back or break it, break it off
Next time you point a finger
I'll point you to the mirror


[Verse 2]
If God's the game that you're playing
Well, we must get more acquainted

Because it has to be so lonely
To be the only one who's holy

It's just my humble opinion
But it's one that I believe in
You don't deserve a point of view
If the only thing you see is you

[Pre-Chorus]
Woah

[Chorus]
You don't have to believe me
But the way I, way I see it
Next time you point a finger
I might have to bend it back or break it, break it off
Next time you point a finger
I'll point you to the mirror


[Bridge]
This is the last second chance
(I'll point you to the mirror)
I'm half as good as it gets
(I'll point you to the mirror)
I'm on both sides of the fence
(I'll point you to the mirror)
Without a hint of regret
I'll hold you to it


[Chorus]
I know you don't believe me
But the way I, way I see it
Next time you point a finger
I might have to bend it back or break it, break it off
Next time you point a finger
I'll point you to the mirror
I know you won't believe me
But the way I, way I see it
Next time you point a finger
I might have to bend it back or break it, break it off
Next time you point a finger
I'll point you to the mirror"
Brick by Boring Brick,brand new eyes,"[Verse 1]
She lives in a fairy tale

Somewhere too far for us to find

Forgotten the taste and smell
Of a world that she's left behind

""It's all about the exposure
The lens,""
I told her
The angles were all wrong, now
She's ripping wings off of butterflies


[Pre-Chorus]
Keep your feet on the ground
When your head's in the clouds

Well, go get your shovel
And we'll dig a deep hole

To bury the castle
Bury the castle

So one day, he found her crying
Coiled up on the dirty ground
Her prince finally came to save her
And the rest you can figure out
But it was a trick
And the clock struck twelve
, well, make sure
To build your home brick by boring brick
Or the wolf's gonna blow it down


[Pre-Chorus]
Keep your feet on the ground
When your head's in the clouds

Well, go get your shovel
And we'll dig a deep hole

Well, you built up a world of magic
Because your real life is tragic
Yeah, you built up a world of magic

Well, if it's not real, you can't hold it in your hand
You can't feel it with your heart
And I won't believe it
But if it's true, you can see it with your eyes
Oh, even in the dark
And that's where I want to be, yeah


[Chorus]
Go get your shovel
(You'll be better off without me now)

And we'll dig a deep hole

To bury the castle

Go get your shovel

Turn It Off,brand new eyes,"[Verse 1]
I scraped my knees while I was praying
And found a demon in my safest haven

Seems like it's getting harder to believe in anything
Than just to get lost in all my selfish thoughts

I wanna know what it'd be like
To find perfection in my pride, to see nothing in the light
Or turn it off in all my spite
In all my spite, I'll turn it off


[Chorus]
And the worst part is before it gets any better
We're headed for a cliff
And in the freefall, I will realize I'm better off
When I hit the bottom


[Verse 2]
The tragedy, it seems unending
I'm watching everyone I looked up to breaking, bending
Or taking shortcuts and false solutions
Just to come out the hero

Well, I can see behind the curtain (I can see now)
The wheels are cranking, turning, it's all wrong the way we're working
Towards a goal that's nonexistent
It's nonexistent, but we just keep believing

[Chorus]
And the worst part is before it gets any better
We're headed for a cliff
And in the freefall, I will realize I'm better off
When I hit the bottom


[Bridge]
I wanna know what it'd be like
To find perfection in my pride
, to see nothing in the light
And turn it off in all my spite
In all my spite, I'll turn it off, just turn it off
Again
Again, again

[Chorus]
And the worst part is before it gets any better
We're headed for a cliff
And in the freefall, I will realize I'm better off
When I hit the bottom
And the worst part is before it gets any better
We're headed for a cliff
And in the freefall, I will realize I'm better off
When I hit the bottom"
The Only Exception,brand new eyes,"[Verse 1]

When I was younger, I saw
My daddy cry and curse at the wind
He broke his own heart and I watched
As he tried to reassemble it
And my mama swore that she would
Never let herself forget
And that was the day that I promised
I'd never sing of love if it does not exist


[Chorus]
But, darling, you are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception


[Verse 2]
Maybe I know somewhere
Deep in my soul that love never lasts

And we've got to find other ways
To make it alone or keep a straight face
And I've always lived like this
Keeping a comfortable distance

And up until now, I had sworn
To myself that I'm content with loneliness

Because none of it was ever worth the risk

[Chorus]
Well, you are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception


[Bridge]
I've got a tight grip on reality, but I can't
Let go of what's in front of me here

I know you're leaving in the morning when you wake up
Leave me with some kind of proof it's not a dream, oh


[Chorus]
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception

Feeling Sorry,brand new eyes,"[Verse 1]
We still live in the same town, well, don't we?
But I don't see you around anymore
I go to all the same places, not even a trace of you

Your days are numbered at twenty-four


[Pre-Chorus]
And I'm getting bored waiting 'round for you
We're not getting any younger and I
Won't look back 'cause there's no use
It's time to move forward


[Chorus]

I feel no sympathy
You live inside a cave

You barely get by, the rest of us are trying
There's no need to apologize
I've got no time for feeling sorry

[Verse 2]
I try not to think of what might happen
When your reality, it finally cuts through
Well, as for me, I got out and I'm on the road
The worst part is that this, this, this could be you

[Pre-Chorus]
You know it too, you can't run from your shame
You're not getting any younger and time
Keeps passing by, but you wave it away
It's time to roll over

[Chorus]

I feel no sympathy
You live inside a cave
You barely get by, the rest of us are trying
There's no need to apologize
I've got no time for feeling sorry

[Bridge]
And all the best lies
They are told with fingers tied
So cross them tight
Won't you promise me tonight
If it's the last thing you do, you'll get out

[Chorus]

I feel no sympathy
You live inside a cave
You barely get by, the rest of us are trying
There's no need to apologize
I've got no time, got no time
I feel no sympathy
You live inside a cave
You barely get by, the rest of us are trying
There's no need to apologize
I've got no time
I've got no time for feeling sorry
I've got no time for feeling sorry"
Looking Up,brand new eyes,"[Verse 1]
Things are looking up, oh, finally
I thought I'd never see the day when you'd smile at me

We always pull through, oh, when we try
I'm always wrong, but you're never right
Oh, you're never right

[Chorus]
Honestly, can you believe
We cross the world while it's asleep?

I'll never trade it in
'Cause I've always wanted this and
It's not a dream anymore
No
It's not a dream anymore
It's worth fighting for


[Verse 2]
Could've given up so easily
I was a few cheap shots away from the end of me

Taking for granted 'most everything
That I would've died for just yesterday
Just yesterday


[Chorus]
Honestly, can you believe
We cross the world while it's asleep?

I'll never trade it in
'Cause I've always wanted this and
It's not a dream anymore
No
It's not a dream anymore
It's worth fighting for

God knows the world doesn't need another band
Woah, oh, oh, woah, oh, oh
But what a waste it would've been
Woah, oh, oh, woah, oh, oh

Where the Lines Overlap,brand new eyes,"[Verse 1]
Give me attention, I need it now
Too much distance to measure it out, out loud

Tracing patterns across a personal map
And making pictures where the lines overlap

Where the lines overlap

[Chorus]
No one is as lucky as us
We're not at the end, but, oh, we already won
No, no, no one
Is as lucky as us, is as lucky as us

Call me over and tell me how
Well, you got so far and never making a single sound
I'm not used to it, but I can learn
There's nothing to it, I've never been happier

I've never been happier

No one is as lucky as us
We're not at the end, but, oh, we already won
Oh, no, no one

And now I've got a feeling if I sang this loud enough
You would sing it back to me
I've got a feeling if I sang this loud enough
You would sing it back to me
I've got a feeling, I've got a feeling
That you would sing it back to me
You would sing it back to me

Misguided Ghosts,brand new eyes,"[Intro]
One, two, three, four

[Verse 1]
I am going away for a while
But I'll be back, don't try and follow me
'Cause I'll return as soon as possible
See, I'm trying to find my place
But it might not be here where I feel safe
We all learn to make mistakes

[Pre-Chorus]
And run from them, from them
With no direction
We'll run from them, from them
With no conviction

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm just one of those ghosts
Traveling endlessly

Don't need no roads
In fact, they follow me
And we just go in circles


[Verse 2]
Now I'm told that this is life
And pain is just a simple compromise
So we can get what we want out of it

Would someone care to classify
Our broken hearts and twisted minds?
So I can find someone to rely on

[Pre-Chorus]
And run to them, to them
Full speed ahead

Oh, you are not useless
We are just

[Chorus]
Misguided ghosts
Traveling endlessly

The ones we trusted the most
Pushed us far away

And there's no one road

We should not be the same
But I'm just a ghost

And still they echo me
They echo me in circles"
All I Wanted,brand new eyes,"[Verse 1]
Think of me when you're out, when you're out there

I'll beg you nice from my knees
And when the world treats you way too fairly
Well, it's a shame I'm a dream

[Chorus]
All I wanted was you
All I wanted was you


[Verse 2]
I think I'll pace my apartment a few times
And fall asleep on the couch
And wake up early to black-and-white reruns
That escape from my mouth
(Oh, oh)

[Chorus]
All I wanted was you
All I wanted was you
All I wanted was you
All I wanted was you

[Verse 3]
I could follow you to the beginning
Just to relive the start

And maybe then, we'd remember to slow down
At all of our favorite parts

All I wanted was you

All I wanted was you
All I wanted was you
All I wanted was you
All I wanted was you"
Monster,Singles Club,"[Verse 1]
You were my conscience
So solid, now you're like water

And we started drowning
Not like we'd sink any farther
But I let my heart go
It's somewhere down at the bottom
But I'll get a new one
And come back for the hope that you've stolen

[Chorus]
I'll stop the whole world
I'll stop the whole world from turning into a monster
Eating us alive

I'm only human

And they're getting stronger
I hear them calling

And not always knowing the answers
But you're gonna lose it
You're gonna lose it

I'll stop the whole world from turning into a monster
Eating us alive
Don't you ever wonder how we survive?

I'll stop the whole world from turning into a monster
Eating us alive
Don't you ever wonder how we survive?

Renegade,Singles Club,"[Verse 1]
And the grass wasn't green enough here
After watering it with my tears

I'm not sure where you went
Now we are just past tense

And the snakes, they are slithering in
Chasing me to my end

I can't say where that is
I'm running again

And when I get there
It won't be far enough
I'm a renegade
It's in my blood
If ever I get there
It won't be fast enough
I'm a renegade

And the spark never lit up a fire
Though I tried and tried and tried

The wind came from your lungs
A hurricane from your tongue
I'll keep your secrets with me
Right behind my teeth
Your anger, your anchor
But I'll sail much further on
Ah-ah, ah-ah, on

I'm overjoyed, I'm undecided and I don't know who I am
Well, maybe I'm not perfect, at least I'm working on it
22 is like the worst idea that I've ever had
It's too much pain, it's too much freedom, what should I do with this?
It's not the way you plan it, it's how you make it happen
Yeah, it's how you make it happen

[Chorus]
It's such a cold, cold world (Hello cold world)
And I can't get out
So I'll just make the best of everything I'll never have
Such a cold, cold world (Hello cold world)
And it's got me down
But I'll get right back up as long as its spins around
Hello cold world
Whoa-ooh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
Girls and boys keep lining up to see if they can measure up
They look good and they feel wild but it will never be enough
You say you're really hurting, at least you're feeling something
We can hope and we can pray that everything will work out fine
But you can't just stay down on your knees, the revolution is outside
You wanna make a difference, get out and go begin it
Whoa, get out and go begin it

[Chorus]
It's such a cold, cold world (Hello cold world)
And I can't get out
So I'll just make the best of everything I'll never have
Such a cold, cold world (Hello cold world)
And it's got me down
But I'll get right back up as long as its spins around
Hello cold world

[Bridge]
Oh-ooh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Don't need my eyes open wide

Oh-ooh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I just wanna feel something

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Such a cold, cold world (Hello cold world)
And I can't get out
So I'll just make the best of everything I'll never have
Such a cold, cold world (Hello cold world)
And it's got me down
But I'll get right back up as long as its spins around
Spins around
Whoa-ooh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (Hello cold world)
Whoa-ooh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (Hello cold world)"
In The Mourning,Singles Club,"[Verse 1]
You escaped like a runaway train
Off the tracks and down again

And my heart's beating like a steam boat tugging


[Pre-Chorus]
All your burdens
On my shoulders


[Chorus]
And in the mourning I'll rise

In the mourning I'll let you die

In the mourning, all my worries

[Verse 2]
And now there's nothing but time that's wasted

And words that have no backbone
And now it seems like the whole world's waiting


[Pre-Chorus]
Can you hear the
Echoes fading?

[Chorus]
In the mourning I'll rise
In the mourning I'll let you die
In the mourning, all my sorries

[Bridge]
And it takes all my strength
Not to dig you up
From the ground in which you lay

The biggest part of me
You were the greatest thing
And now you're just a memory
To let go of


[Chorus]
And in the mourning I'll rise
And in the mourning I'll let you die
In the mourning, all my sorries

[Outro]
In the mourning I'll rise
In the mourning I'll let you die
In the mourning, all my sorries"
Fast in My Car,Paramore,"[Verse 1]
Been through the ringer a couple times
I came out callous and cruel

And my two friends know this very well
Because they went through it too

The three of us were initiates
We had to learn how to deal
And when we spotted a second chance
We had to learn how to steal


[Pre-Chorus]
Hollowed out and filled up with hate

All we want is you to give us a break


[Chorus]
We're driving fast in my car

We've got our riot gear on, but we just want to have fun
No, we're not looking for violence, oh, oh
Tonight we want to have fun


[Verse 2]
No one's the same as they used to be
Much as we try to pretend
No one's as innocent as could be
We all fall short, we all sin

But now we aren't looking backward
We won't try raising the dead

We only see what's in front of us
We only see straight ahead

[Pre-Chorus]
Hollowed out and filled up with hate
All we want is you to give us a break


[Chorus]
We're driving fast in my car

We've got our riot gear on, but we just want to have fun
No, we're not looking for violence, oh, oh
Tonight we want to have fun


[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
Get in my car and we'll drive around
We'll make believe we are free
Already proved we can tough it out
And we get along so sweetly


[Chorus]
We're driving fast in my car

We've got our riot gear on, but we just want to have fun
No, we're not looking for violence, oh, oh
Tonight we want to have fun (Oh, oh, oh)

We're driving fast in my car
We're driving fast in my car

And we're not looking for violence, oh, oh

We're driving fast in my car and we want just to have fun"
Now,Paramore,"[Intro]
Don't try to take this from me
Don't try to take this from me now

Don't try to take this from me
Don't try to take this from me now


[Verse 1]
Feels like I'm waking from the dead
And everyone's been waiting on me

Least now I'll never have to wonder
What it's like to sleep a year away

But weren't we indestructible?
I thought that we could brave it all

I never thought that what would take me out
Was hiding down below


[Pre-Chorus]
Lost the battle, win the war
I'm bringing my sinking ship back to the shore

Starting over
or head back in

There's a time and a place to die, but this ain't it


[Chorus]
If there's a future, we want it now
If there's a future, we want it now
If there's a future, we want it now
If there's a future, we want it now

[Post-Chorus]
Don't try to take this from me
Don't try to take this from me now

Don't try to take this from me
Don't try to take this from me now


[Verse 2]
Wish I could find a crystal ball
For the days I feel completely worthless

You know I'd use it all for good
I would not take it for granted

Instead, I have some memories
For the days I don't feel anything

At the least, they will remind me not to make
The same mistakes again


[Pre-Chorus]
Lost the battle, win the war
I'm bringing my sinking ship back to the shore

Starting over
or head back in

There's a time and a place to die, but this ain't it


[Chorus]
If there's a future, we want it now
If there's a future, we want it now
If there's a future, we want it now
If there's a future, we want it now

[Bridge]
There's a time and a place to die

There's a time and a place to die and this ain't it

There's a time and a place to die and this ain't it
This ain't it
This ain't it

There's a time and a place to die, there's a time and a place to die
But this ain't it, no


[Chorus]
If there's a future, we want it now
If there's a future, we want it now
If there's a future, we want it now
If there's a future, we want it now
Now, now"
Grow Up,Paramore,"[Verse 1]
I told 'em all where to stick it

I left town with a dime to my name

Said I'm done with all of my fake friends
Self-righteous pawns in a losing game

Got my band and a light that won't go out
Been burning since the day I was born

So I'll cry just a little, then I'll dry my eyes
'Cause I'm not a little girl no more


[Chorus]
Some of us have to grow up sometimes
And so, if I have to, I'm gonna leave you behind
Some of us have to grow up sometimes
And so, if I have to, I'm gonna leave you behind


[Verse 2]
Stood in line for so long just to picket
Something I won't ever understand

Aren't you tired of always being mad at the world?
Won't you just admit you don't care?

And, lady, I don't want your pity
So don't feel sad for me

I got a love I would die for and a song to sing
Maybe we're both just living out our dream

[Chorus]
Some of us have to grow up sometimes
And so, if I have to, I'm gonna leave you behind
Some of us have to grow up sometimes
And so, if I have to, I'm gonna leave you behind


[Bridge]
We get along for the most part
Me and reality, the light and the dark
We live alone in two different worlds
Me in a fantasy, you in your memories

But we get along (We get along)
For the most part (We get along)
Yeah, for the most part (We get along)
For the most part (We get along)


[Break]
We get along
We get along


[Chorus]
Some of us have to grow up sometimes
And so, if I have to, I'm gonna leave you behind (Leave you behind)
Some of us have to grow up sometimes
And so, if I have to, I'm gonna leave you behind (Leave you behind)

Some of us have to grow up sometimes
(We grow up, never grow old)

And so, if I have to, I'm gonna leave you behind
Some of us have to grow up sometimes
(We grow up, never grow old)

And so, if I have to, I'm gonna leave you behind"
Daydreaming,Paramore,"[Verse 1]
Living in a city of sleepless people
Who all know their limits and won't go too far
Outside the lines

'Cause they're out of their minds


[Verse 2]
I wanna get out and build my own home
On a street where reality is not much different
From dreams I've had

A dream is all I have


[Chorus]
Daydreaming
Daydreaming all the time
Daydreaming
Daydreaming into the night

Daydreaming
Daydreaming all the time
Daydreaming
Daydreaming into the night and I'm alright


[Verse 3]
Creep past the hours like the shorter hand on the clock
Hanging on the wall of a schoolhouse somewhere
We wait for the bell

And we dream of somewhere else

[Chorus]
Daydreaming
Daydreaming all the time
Daydreaming
Daydreaming into the night

Daydreaming
Daydreaming all the time
Daydreaming
Daydreaming into the night and I'm alright


[Bridge]
It's not that I won't remember where I'm from
Just don't wanna be here no more

It's not enough, oh (We're only half alive)

I'm gonna go, oh (We're only half alive)
Where the rest of the dreamers go, oh (We're only half alive)
Where the dreamers go, oh

Ooh

[Chorus]
Daydreaming
Daydreaming all the time (A dream is all I have)
Daydreaming
Daydreaming into the night and I'm alright

Daydreaming
Daydreaming all the time (A dream is all I have)
Daydreamer
We used to be half alive, now I'm alright

[Outro]
I'm alright
I'm alright"
Interlude: Moving On,Paramore,"[Verse 1]
Let 'em have their time
Sit back and let 'em shine
Let 'em rise and rise
'Cause one day they're gonna fall
Let 'em soak in the sun
Sit back and let 'em have their fun
Let 'em spill their guts
'Cause one day they're gonna slip on 'em


[Chorus]
Well, I could be angry, but you're not worth the fight
And, besides, I'm moving on
I've counted to ten and now I'm feeling alright
And, besides, I'm moving on


[Verse 2]
Let 'em play their songs

Let 'em say what's right and wrong

Let 'em do their thing
'Cause that'll never be you and me

We got our own style
We got a way of living life
If they can't get down
Well, we don't need them around

[Chorus]
Well, I could be angry, but you're not worth the fight
And, besides, I'm moving on
I've counted to ten and now I'm feeling alright
And, besides, I'm moving, yes, I'm moving
Besides, I'm moving on"
Ain't It Fun,Paramore,"[Verse 1]
I don't mind lettin' you down easy, but just give it time
If it don't hurt now, a-just wait, just wait a while

You're not the big fish in the pond no more
You are what they're feedin' on


[Pre-Chorus]
So what are you gonna do
When the world don't orbit around you? Ooh, uh, uh
So what are you gonna do
When the world don't orbit around you?


[Chorus]
Ain't it fun
Livin' in the real world?
Ain't it good
Bein' all alone?


[Verse 2]
Where you're from, you might be the one who's runnin' things

Well, you could ring anybody's bell and get what you want

See, it's easy to ignore trouble
When you're livin' in a bubble


[Pre-Chorus]
So what are you gonna do
When the world don't orbit around you? Mm, uh, uh
So what are you gonna do
When nobody wants to fool with you? Oh, uh

[Chorus]
Ain't it fun
Livin' in the real world?
Ain't it good
Bein' all alone?

Ain't it good to be on your own? (Oh)
Ain't it fun you can't count on no one? (Oh)
Ain't it good to be on your own? (Ah)

Ain't it fun you can't count on no one? (Ah)
Ain't it fun
Livin' in the real world?

Don't go cryin' to your mama
'Cause you're on your own in the real world
Don't go cryin' to your mama
'Cause you're on your own in the real world
Don't go cryin' to your mama
'Cause you're on your own in the real world
Don't go cryin' to your mama
'Cause you're on your own in the real world

Ain't it fun
Livin' in the real world?
Ain't it good
Ain't it good bein' all alone?
Ain't it fun
Livin' in the real world?

Ain't it good
Ain't it good bein' all alone? (Ah, ah)

Don't go cryin'
To your mama (Not to your mama)
'Cause you're on your own
In the real world (Don't go cryin')
Don't go cryin'

Part II,Paramore,"[Verse 1]
What a shame, what a shame we all remain
Such fragile broken things

A beauty half betrayed
Butterflies with punctured wings

Still there are darkened places
Deep in my heart
Where once was blazing light, now
There's a tiny spark


[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, glory
Come and find me
Oh, glory
Come and find me


[Chorus]
Dancing all alone to the sound of an enemy's song
I'll be lost until you find me
Fighting on my own in a war that's already been won

I'll be lost until you come and find me here, oh, glory


[Verse 2]
What a mess, what a mystery we've made
Of love and other simple things

Learning to forgive
Even when it wasn't a mistake

I question every human
Who won't look in my eyes
Scars left on my heart formed
Patterns in my mind

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, glory
You will find me


[Chorus]
Dancing all alone to the sound of an enemy's song
I'll be lost until you find me
Fighting on my own in a war that's already been won

I'll be lost until you come and find me here, oh, glory


[Bridge]
(I'll be lost until)

[Outro]
Like the moon, we borrow our light
I am nothing but a shadow in the night
So if you'll let me, I will catch fire
So let your glory and mercy shine"
Last Hope,Paramore,"[Verse 1]
I don't even know myself at all
I thought I would be happy by now

But the more I try to push it, I realize
Gotta let go of control


[Pre-Chorus]
Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen

Gotta let it happen
Just let it happen


[Chorus]
It's just a spark, but it's enough
To keep me going

And when it's dark out, no one's around
It keeps glowing


[Verse 2]
Every night, I try my best to dream
Tomorrow makes it better
Then I wake up to the cold reality
And not a thing is changed


[Pre-Chorus]
But it will happen
Gotta let it happen

Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen

[Chorus]
It's just a spark, but it's enough
To keep me going

And when it's dark out, no one's around
It keeps glowing
(Ah)
It's just a spark, but it's enough
To keep me going

And when it's dark out, no one's around
It keeps glowing


[Verse 3]
And the salt in my wounds
Isn't burning any more than it used to

It's not that I don't feel the pain
It's just I'm not afraid of hurting anymore

And the blood in these veins
Isn't pumping any less than it ever has
And that's the hope I have
The only thing I know is keeping me alive
Alive


[Bridge]
Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen

Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen

Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen

Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen

[Chorus]
It's just a spark, but it's enough
To keep me going
(So if I let go of control now, I can be strong)
And when it's dark out, no one's around
It keeps glowing
(Ah)
It's just a spark, but it's enough
To keep me going
(So if I keep my eyes closed with a blind hope)
And when it's dark out, no one's around
It keeps glowing
(Ah)

[Outro]
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Ooh, ooh, oh
Mm, ooh, ooh"
Still into You,Paramore,"[Verse 1]
Can't count the years on one hand that we've been together
I need the other one to hold you, make you feel, make you feel better

It's not a walk in the park to love each other
But when our fingers interlock, can't deny, can't deny you're worth it


[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause after all this time
I'm still into you


[Chorus]
I should be over all the butterflies
But I'm into you (I'm into you)

And, baby, even on our worst nights
I'm into you (I'm into you)

Let 'em wonder how we got this far
'Cause I don't really need to wonder at all

Yeah, after all this time
I'm still into you


[Verse 2]
Recount the night that I first met your mother
And on the drive back to my house, I told you that, I told you that I loved ya

You felt the weight of the world fall off your shoulder

And to your favorite song,
we sang along to the start of forever

[Pre-Chorus]
And after all this time
I'm still into you


[Chorus]
I should be over all the butterflies
But I'm into you (I'm into you)

And, baby, even on our worst nights
I'm into you (I'm into you)

Let 'em wonder how we got this far
'Cause I don't really need to wonder at all

Yeah, after all this time
I'm still into you


[Bridge]
Some things just, some things just make sense
And one of those is you and I (Hey)
Some things just, some things just make sense
And even after all this time (Hey)

I'm into you
Baby, not a day goes by that I'm not into you


[Chorus]
I should be over all the butterflies
But I'm into you (I'm into you)

And, baby, even on our worst nights
I'm into you (I'm into you)

Let 'em wonder how we got this far
'Cause I don't really need to wonder at all

Yeah, after all this time
I'm still into you
I'm still into you
I'm still into you"
Anklebiters,Paramore,"[Verse 1]
Why do you care what people think?
Are you hooked up to their leash?
You know anklebiters
Ate up your personality

Try to remember how it felt

To just make up your own steps
And let anklebiters
Chew up, spit out someone else


[Pre-Chorus]
Fall in love with yourself
Because


[Chorus]
Someday you're gonna be the only one you've got
Someday you're gonna be the only one you've got

Why you wanna please the world and leave yourself to drop dead?

Someday you're gonna be the only one you've got


[Verse 2]
What do you actually expect?
A broken mirror to reflect?

You know anklebiters
Gave you a false perception

And why do I (Come on, come on)
Defend your ignorance?
Oh, why do I (Come on, come on)
Defend the state you're in?

[Pre-Chorus]
You should fall in love with yourself
Oh, again

Fall in love with yourself
Because


[Chorus]
Someday you're gonna be the only one you've got
Someday you're gonna be the only one you've got

Why you wanna please the world and leave yourself to drop dead?

Someday you're gonna be
the only one you've got


[Outro]
Anklebiters
Anklebiters
Someday you're gonna be alone

Interlude: Holiday,Paramore,"[Intro]
(Mhm)

[Verse]
Now I can move on to facing big girl problems
No more high school drama, graduated with honors

And I'm drinking coffee while I read the paper
I've been saving money eating only top ramen


[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
Now I get a holiday
Wherever I go, I might stay
I don't plan on coming back
Ever if I can help it


[Outro]
Now I get a holiday
Think I'll stay
Holiday
Think I'll stay
Now I get a holiday"
Proof,Paramore,"[Verse 1]
It's really hard, I can't cry in your arms 'cause you're not here

It's not your fault and if it was, I wouldn't care

My heart is bigger than the distance in between us

I know it 'cause I feel it beating


[Interlude]
So strong it'll knock you down
So strong, so strong


[Verse 2]
Over here, I can't count the miles away from where I wanna be
I bet your skin is warm and that you're smiling
Yeah, that's what I always loved the most about you
You're so strong, come and knock me down, hey

[Chorus]
Baby, if I'm half the man I say I am (Woah)
If I'm a woman with no fear just like I claim I am (Woah)
Then I'll believe in what you say, there's nothing left for you to do
The only proof that I need is you


[Verse 3]
I'll get in my car, drive it faster than I ever did before

Head out west until I finally reach the shore
And then I'll swim out to wherever you are
And we'll ride the undercurrent down
To the floor, making friends with all the unfamiliar creatures

And pushing back on the unnecessary pressure
Come up for air just so you know we won't drown
You're so strong, the world can't keep us down, hey

[Chorus]
Baby, if I'm half the man I say I am (Woah)
If I'm a woman with no fear just like I claim I am (Woah)
Then I'll believe in what you say, there's nothing left for you to do
The only proof that I need is you


[Post-Chorus]
Yeah
Ooh, yeah
Yeah
Ooh, yeah

[Bridge]
So do you love me? (Yeah)
All you gotta do is say yes
Now do you love me? (Yeah)
And I won't ever second-guess
Now do you love me? (Yeah)
All you gotta do is say yes
Now do you love me? (Yeah)
Then you already proved it

Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Baby, if I'm half the man I say I am (Woah)
If I'm a woman with no fear just like I claim I am (Woah)
Then I'll believe in what you say, there's nothing left for you to do
The only proof that I need is
Baby, if I'm half the man I say I am (Woah)
If I'm a woman with no fear just like I claim I am (Woah)
Then I'll believe in what you say, there's nothing left for you to do
The only proof that I need is you"
Hate to See Your Heart Break,Paramore,"[Verse 1]
There is not a single word
In the whole world
That could describe the hurt


[Pre-Chorus]
The dullest knife just sawing back and forth
And ripping through the softest skin there ever was

How were you to know?
Oh, how were you to know?


[Chorus]
And I
I hate to see your heart break
I hate to see your eyes get darker as they close

But I've been there before

And I
I hate to see your heart break
I hate to see your eyes get darker as they close

But I've been there before


[Verse 2]
Love happens all the time
To people who aren't kind
And heroes who are blind

[Pre-Chorus]
Expecting perfect scripted movie scenes
Who wants an awkward silent mystery?

How were you to know?
Oh, how were you to know?

[Chorus]
And I
I hate to see your heart break
I hate to see your eyes get darker as they close

But I've been there before

And I
I hate to see your heart break
I hate to see your eyes get darker as they close

But I've been there before


[Bridge]
For all the air that's in your lungs
For all the joy that is to come
For all the things that you're alive to feel
Just let the pain remind you hearts can heal
Oh, how were you to know? (How were you to know?)
Oh, how were you to know?

[Chorus]
And I
I hate to see your heart break
I hate to see your eyes get darker as they close

But I've been there before

And I
I hate to see your heart break
I hate to see your eyes get darker as they close

But I've been there before"
(One of Those) Crazy Girls,Paramore,"[Verse 1]

Now when you say you wanna slow down
Does it mean you wanna slow dance?
Maybe you just want a little extra time to focus
On our romance

What do you mean I got it backwards?
You know we're gonna be forever
Why are you telling me goodbye?
Aren't you gonna stay the night? (Well, alright)


[Chorus]
Are we really over now?
Maybe I can change your mind
Soon as you walk out my door
I'm gonna call a hundred times


[Verse 2]
Now I walk under a pink sky
Lovers float along and pass me by
I pour my heart out to your voicemail

Let you know I caught a bus to your side of town

And now I'm standing at your doorstep
With Los Angeles behind me

If you don't answer, I'll just use the key that I copied
'Cause I really need to see you

[Pre-Chorus]
If you're not here when I break in, I'm gonna go through your closet
Just so I can smell your skin
As the chemicals swim, I know I'll never love again
I swear I'll never love again


[Chorus]
Baby, are we over now?
Maybe I can change your mind
As soon as you walk out my door
I'm gonna call a hundred times

I'm not one of those crazy girls
I'm not one of those crazy girls

Hey baby, are we over now?

Soon as you walk out my door
I'm gonna call a hundred times

Now I'm one of those crazy girls
Now I'm one of those crazy girls"
Interlude: I'm Not Angry Anymore,Paramore,"[Verse 1]
I'm not angry anymore
Well, sometimes I am
I don't think badly of you
Well, sometimes I do


[Chorus]
It depends on the day
The extent of all my worthless rage
I'm not angry anymore


[Verse 2]
I'm not bitter anymore
I'm syrupy sweet
I rot your teeth down to their core
If I'm really happy


[Chorus]
Depends on the day
If I wake up in a giddy haze
Well, I'm not angry
I'm not totally angry
I'm not all that angry anymore"
Be Alone,Paramore,"""Be Alone"" is about Hayley spending much of 2012 as a loner, getting to know herself better. A lot of it can be summed up by this image, which she posted to her Tumblr in May 2012:
[Verse 1]
So what if I don't have a lot to talk about?

I shut my mouth and keep it locked until it counts

And what if I don't ever want to leave my house?
Stay on the couch while all my friends are going out


[Pre-Chorus]
Alone

[Chorus]
You should be alone
Yeah, you should be alone
You should be alone with me
We could be alone
Yeah, we could be alone
But never get too lonely


[Verse 2]
I'll make the journey down the hall back to my room
Kill more time and let it rot inside its tomb (Inside its tomb)

See, I ain't one to climb some social ladder to

Some Shangri-La that all the cool kids will abuse


[Pre-Chorus]
Alone

[Chorus]
You should be alone
Yeah, you should be alone
You should be alone with me
And we could be alone
Yeah, we could be alone
But never get too lonely


[Post-Chorus]
(We could be alone together)

[Bridge]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I'm a loner
I'm in love with you alone

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Come be a loner
Be in love with me alone
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
You should be alone
Yeah, you should be alone
You should be alone with me
We could be alone
Yeah, we could be alone
But never get too lonely

You should be alone
Yeah, you should be alone
You should be alone with me
We could be alone
Yeah, we could be alone
But never get too lonely"
Future,Paramore,"[Spoken Intro]
Yeah
That's how you had it, yeah
Pretty sure
It is, it goes clapping a bit
So interesting that way
Alright, here we go
Gonna go an octave down this time


[Verse 1]
I'm writing the future
I'm writing it out, loud
We don't talk about the past
We don't talk about the past now

So I'm writing the future
I'm leaving a key here
Something won't always be missing
You won't always feel emptier


[Chorus]
Oh
Mm
Oh
Mm

[Verse 2]
Just think of the future
And think of your dreams

You'll get away from here
You'll get away eventually

So just think of the future
Think of a new life
And don't get lost in the memories
Keep your eyes on a new prize

[Chorus]
Ah
Ah
Ah
Ah
Mm
Mm
Mm"
Escape Route,Paramore (Deluxe Edition),"Originally released as a Japan radio exclusive until the release of the deluxe edition of Paramore, ""Escape Route"" shows Hayley moving on form the departure of the Farro brothers.
[Verse 1]
I've got a life out there somewhere, it's waiting
Lined with palm trees and only new faces
If I could look past the present and get there
Well, baby, it's worth a shot

Just enough time to plan an escape route
I put my map on the wall in the basement
Not quite a victory to run from your problems
But it's the only plan that I got
It's the only plan that I got


[Chorus]
And if you try to find me now (Oh, oh, oh)
I'm in all the echoes that have faded out, so
I'm moving on 'cause I just want to feel for once that I belong
And that's what's going on, that's what's going on


[Verse 2]
Crossed the state line and called out a warning
Not too long now, I'll breathe California

Paid my dues and I tried to be loyal
But now I'm done with all that

Where I'm going is everyone's story

We want new lives, we'd love to start over

It's not a question of who are we really
It's who we wanna be

[Chorus]
And if you try to find me now (Oh, oh, oh)
I'm in all the echoes that have faded out, so
I'm moving on 'cause I just want to feel for once that I belong
And that's what's going on


[Bridge]
All that's in between
A brand new life and I is time
But time has not been kind
It's not been kind to me
It's winding backwards

Time has not been kind
It's crawling by
So slowly

[Chorus]
And if you try to find me now (Oh, oh, oh)
I'm in all the echoes that have faded out, so
I'm moving on 'cause I just want to feel for once that I belong
And that's what's going on
And if you try to find me now (Oh, oh, oh)
I'm in all the echoes that have faded out, so
I'm moving on 'cause I just want to feel for once that I belong
And that's what's going on"
Native Tongue,Paramore (Deluxe Edition),"[Verse 1]
How can they say
That it's one way
When it's the opposite?
And how can they know
The end of the story
Before I tell it?


'Cause when I walk
Your feet, they fall
To the same beat

Or maybe we're from two different worlds
But we've got our own language

[Pre-Chorus]
We talk to people
But they never understand
They think we're crazy
'Cause it sounds like noise


[Chorus]
When we're speaking in our native
Speaking in our native tongue
We're speaking in our native
Speaking in our native tongue

[Verse 2]
We used to live
Like we were strangers

We didn't know any better

We didn't fit
In with the out crowd

So we gave in
And we shut our mouths


But oh, I love your history
And I can take it

And when you talk in code to me
I can translate it


[Pre-Chorus]
We talk to people
But they never understand
They think we're crazy
'Cause it sounds like noise to them

Ain't it strange
All the things you hear
When you sit
And listen?


[Chorus]
When we're speaking in our native
Speaking in our native tongue
We're speaking in our native
Speaking in our native tongue

[Post-Chorus]
And all this time I've been wasting my breath
Just wasting my words on everyone else
Now speaking in my native
Speaking in my native tongue


[Bridge]
So come on
Talk it out
So come on
Talk it out
So come on
And talk, talk, talk, talk, talk
Talk it out
(Your voice, it brought me back from the dead, somehow)
So come on
And talk, talk, talk, talk, talk
Talk it out


[Break]
Out!
Out!
Out!

[Chorus]
Speaking in our native
Speaking in our native tongue
We're speaking in our native
Speaking in our native tongue

[Outro]
And all this time I've been wasting my breath
Just wasting my words on everyone else
I'm speaking in my native
Speaking in my native tongue"
Tell Me It's Okay (Demo),Paramore (Deluxe Edition),"[Verse 1]
Maybe it's been years since I genuinely smiled

And maybe it's been years since I wanted to be a part of anything

But lately I've been good, you know, I've actually been great

Man, I even laughed a little today, oh, so strange, so strange

[Chorus]
Tell me it's okay to be happy now, because I'm happy now

Tell me it's okay to be happy now, because I'm happy now
Tell me it's okay, tell me it's okay
Tell me it's okay, tell me it's okay

[Verse 2]
Thought it was my right to be as sorry as I wanted to be
I wasted all my teenage years being a misery factory

But something had to give, I had to finally see the light
I think at 23 it's time to practice what I preach

And what I preach is

[Chorus]
Tell me it's okay to be happy now, because I'm happy now
Tell me it's okay to be happy now, because I'm happy now
Tell me it's okay, tell me it's okay
Tell me it's okay, tell me it's okay

[Bridge]
All my wasted hope
I let go when I should've held tighter
And now when the is sun out
I let it burn
, not afraid to feel it shine on me

[Pre-Chorus]
It's okay
Tell me it's okay, tell me it's okay
Tell me it's okay, tell me it's okay
Tell me it's okay, tell me it's okay
Tell me it's okay

[Chorus]
Tell me it's okay to be happy now, because I'm happy now
Tell me it's okay to be happy now, my life is finally leveling out,
so
Tell me it's okay to be happy now, because I'm happy now
Tell me it's okay to be happy now, my life is finally leveling out, so

Tell me it's okay, tell me it's okay
Tell me it's okay, tell me it's okay
Tell me it's okay, tell me it's okay
Tell me it's okay, tell me it's okay"
Hard Times,After Laughter,"[Intro]
One, two

[Verse 1]
All that I want
Is to wake up fine
Tell me that I'm alright
That I ain't gonna die

All that I want
Is a hole in the ground
You can tell me when it's alright
For me to come out


[Chorus]
Hard times

Hard times
Gonna take you down and laugh when you cry
These lives
And I still don't know how I even survive
Hard times, hard times

And I gotta get to rock bottom

With my little rain cloud
Hangin' over my head
And it ain't coming down

Where do I go?
Give me some sort of sign
You hit me with lightning
Maybe I'll come alive

Hard times
Gonna make you wonder why you even try
Hard times
Gonna take you down and laugh when you cry

Tell my friends I'm coming down
We'll kick it when I hit the ground
When I hit the ground
When I hit the ground
When I hit the ground
When I hit the ground

Hard times
Gonna make you wonder why you even try
Hard times
Gonna take you down and laugh when you cry
These lives
And I still don't know how I even survive
Hard times (Hard times), hard times (Hard times)

Makes you wonder why you even try
Makes you wonder why you even try
Makes you wonder

Still don't know how I even survive
Still don't know how I even survive
Still don't know how I survive

And I gotta get to rock bottom

And, oh, I'm so annoyed
'Cause I just killed off what was left of the optimist in me

And, ooh, hearts are breakin' and wars are ragin' on

You say my eyes are gettin' too dark now
But, boy, you ain't ever seen my mind

Just let me cry a little bit longer
I ain't gon' smile if I don't want to
Hey, man, we all can't be like you
I wish we were all rose-colored too

Told You So,After Laughter,"[Verse 1]
For all I know
The best is over and the worst is yet to come

Is it enough
To keep on hopin' when the rest have given up?


[Pre-Chorus]
And they go


[Chorus]
""I hate to say 'I told you so'""
But they love to say they told me so
""I hate to say 'I told you so'""
But they love to say they told me

Forgiveness,After Laughter,"[Verse 1]
You hurt me bad this time, no coming back

And I cried 'til I couldn't cry, another heart attack
If I lay on the floor, maybe I'll wake up

And I don't pick up when you call 'cause your voice is a gun
Every word is a bullet hole
, shot a hole in the sun

If I never look up, maybe I'll never notice


[Chorus]
And you, you want forgiveness
But I, I just can't do it yet


[Verse 2]
There's still a thread that runs from your body to mine
And you can't break what you don't see, an invisible line

If I follow it down, will we just be alright?

But it could take me all your life to learn to love
How I thought I could love someone, I haven't even begun

If it's all up to us, we might as well give up


[Chorus]
And you, you want forgiveness
(I can barely hang on to myself)
But I, I can't give you that
(I can't give you, I can't give you that)
And you, you want forgiveness
(I'm afraid that I'll have nothing left)
But I, I just can't do it yet
(I can't do, I just can't do it yet)

[Bridge]
Don't you go and get it twisted
Forgiving is not forgetting
Don't you go and get it twisted
Forgiving is not forgetting
No, it's not forgetting
No, I'll never forget it, no


[Chorus]
And you, you want forgiveness
(I can barely hang on to myself)
But I, I can't give you that
(I can't give you, I can't give you that)
And you, you want forgiveness
(I'm afraid that I'll have nothing left)
But I, I just can't do it yet
(I can't do, I just can't do it yet)"
Fake Happy,After Laughter,"[Intro]
I love makin' you believe what you get is what you see
But I'm so fake happy, I feel so fake happy
And I bet everybody here is just as insincere
We're all so fake happy and I know fake happy


[Verse 1]
See, I been doin' a good job of makin' 'em think
I'm quite alright, better hope I don't blink
You see, it's easy when I'm stompin' on a beat
But no one sees me when I crawl back underneath


[Pre-Chorus]
Hey, if I smile with my teeth
I bet you believe me
If I smile with my teeth
I think I believe me


[Chorus]
Oh, please, don't ask me how I've been
Don't make me play pretend, oh, no
Oh, what's the use?
Oh, please, I bet everybody here is fake happy too


[Verse 2]
And if I go out tonight, dress up my fears
You think I look alright with these mascara tears?
See, I'm gonna draw my lipstick wider than my mouth
And if the lights are low, they'll never see me frown

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey, if I smile with my teeth
I bet you believe me
If I smile with my teeth
I think I believe me


[Chorus]
Oh, please, don't ask me how I've been
Don't make me play pretend, oh, no
Oh, oh, what's the use?
Oh, please, I bet everybody here is fake happy too

I know I said that I was doin' good
And that I'm happy now (Ooh)
I shoulda known when things were goin' good
That's when I'd get knocked down

26,After Laughter,"[Verse 1]
Man, you really know how to get someone down
Everything was fine until you came around

And I've been chasing after dreamers in the clouds
After all, wasn't I the one who said
To keep your feet on the ground?
Man, you really brought me back down


[Chorus]
Hold on to hope if you got it
Don't let it go for nobody

They say that dreaming is free
But I wouldn't care what it cost me


[Verse 2]
You got me tied up, but I stay close to the window
And I talk to myself about the places that I used to go

I'm hoping someday maybe I'll just float away
And I'll forget every cynical thing you say

When you gonna hear me out?
Man, you really bring me down


[Chorus]
Hold on to hope if you got it
Don't let it go for nobody
They say that dreaming is free
But I wouldn't care what it cost me

[Bridge]
Reality will break your heart
Survival will not be the hardest part
It's keeping all your hopes alive
When all the rest of you has died
So let it break your heart


[Chorus]
Hold on to hope if you got it
Don't let it go for nobody
Hold on to hope if you got it
Don't let it go for nobody
They say that dreaming is free
But I wouldn't care what it cost me"
Pool,After Laughter,"[Verse 1]
As if the first cut wasn't deep enough
I dove in again 'cause I'm not into givin' up
Coulda got the same rush from any lover's touch
Why get used to somethin' new? 'Cause no one breaks my heart like you


[Pre-Chorus]
When you kiss me, yeah, I wish we could see what happens next

For a moment, I could forget what happens in my head

If I doubt you, will you come through?
A happy second chance
Or happy ending
, but this time, you don't leave me sinkin'


[Chorus]
(I'm under water) No air in my lungs
(My eyes are open) And I'm givin' up
(You are the wave) I could never tame
If I survive, I'll dive back in


[Verse 2]
As if the first blood didn't thrill enough

I went further out to see what else was left of us

Never found the deep end of our little ocean
I drain the fantasy of you, headfirst into shallow pools


[Pre-Chorus]
And I wonder, is it better to get it over with?
The illusion can shatter before we begin

If you're really sorry, happy second chance
I think I could forgive, but this time, you won't leave me sinkin'

[Chorus]
(I'm under water) No air in my lungs
(My eyes are open) And I'm givin' up
(You are the wave) I could never tame
If I survive, I'll dive back in


[Bridge]
Dive back into (Right back into)
Dive right back into you and now I know you
Now I know you, now that I know you
Dive right back into you
Back into, right back into you
Dive right back into you and now I know you
Now I know you, now that I know you
Dive right back into you


[Chorus]
(I'm under water) No air in my lungs
(My eyes are open) And I'm givin' up
(You are the wave) I could never tame
If I survive, I'll dive back in
(I'm under water) No air in my lungs
(My eyes are open) And I'm givin' up
(You are the wave) I could never tame
If I survive, I'll dive back in
I'll dive back in
I'll dive back"
Grudges,After Laughter,"[Verse 1]
Strange how we found ourselves
Exactly where we left off
I know you're shaking my hand like it is the first time

Are we alright?
Are you recounting all my faults?
And are you racking your brain just to find them all?

Could it be that I've changed?
Or did you?
(Woo)

[Chorus]
Stop asking why
Why we had to waste so much time
Well, we just pick up, pick up and start again
'Cause we can't keep holding on to grudges


[Verse 2]
Time is a bastard
I won't break my neck to get around it

But aren't we so brave to give up a fight
And let the years go by without us?
'Cause now I feel you by my side
And I don't even care if it's been a while

I can feel that we've changed
And we're better this way
(Woo)

[Chorus]
Stop asking why
Why we had to waste so much time
Well, we just pick up, pick up and start again
'Cause we can't keep holding on to grudges


[Post-Chorus]
If you wanna call me up or come over
Come on, we'll laugh 'til we cry
Like we did when we were kids

'Cause we can't keep holding on to grudges

Why did it take so long?
Why did it take so long?
Why did it take us so long to just let it go?
Why did it take us so long? Stop holding on

Stop asking why
Why we had to waste so much time
Well, we just pick up, pick up and start again
'Cause we can't keep holding on to grudges

Come on, we'll laugh 'til we cry
Like we did when we were kids

Could it be that I've changed?
Could it be that I've changed?
Could it be that I've changed?
Or did you?"
Caught in the Middle,After Laughter,"[Intro]
One, two

[Verse 1]
I can't think of getting old
It only makes me want to die

And I can't think of who I was
'Cause it just makes me want to cry, cry, cry (Cry)


[Pre-Chorus]
Can't look back
Can't look too far ahead
I got the point
I got the message


[Chorus]
I'm just a little bit caught in the middle
I try to keep going, but it's not that simple
I think I'm a little bit caught in the middle
I gotta keep going or they'll call me a quitter
Yeah, I'm caught in the middle


[Verse 2]
I was dreaming life away

All the while just going blind
Can't see the forest for the trees
Behind the lids of my own eyes

Nostalgia's cool
But it won't help you now
A dream is good (Don't wear it out)
If you don't wear it out

And I'm just a little bit caught in the middle
I try to keep going, but it's not that simple
I think I'm a little bit caught in the middle
I gotta keep going or they'll call me a quitter
Yeah, I'm caught in the middle


[Bridge]
No, I don't need no help
I can sabotage me by myself
I don't need no one else
I can sabotage me by myself
I don't need no help
I can sabotage me by myself
I don't need no one else
I can sabotage me by myself (All the glory days are gone)
I don't need no help
I can sabotage me by myself (It's over now, I'm on my own)
I don't need no one else
I can sabotage me by myself (All the glory days are gone)
I don't need no help
I can sabotage me by myself (It's over now, I'm on my own)
I don't need no one else
I can sabotage me by myself

And I'm just a little bit caught in the middle
I try to keep going, but it's not that simple
I think I'm a little bit caught in the middle
I gotta keep going or they'll call me a quitter
Yeah, I'm caught in the middle


[Outro]
I'm caught in the middle"
Idle Worship,After Laughter,"[Verse 1]
Standing here like I'm supposed to say something

Don't hold your breath, I never said I'd save you, honey

And I don't want your money
, if I was you, I'd run from me or
Rip me open
, you'll see you're not the only one who's hopeless

Be sure to put your faith in something more
I'm just a girl and you're not as alone as you feel
We all got problems, don't we? We all need heroes, don't we?
But rest assured there's not a single person here who's worthy


[Pre-Chorus]
La, la-la-la-la, la-la
Don't let me let you down


[Chorus]
(Eh, eh, eh, eh)
Hey, baby, I'm not your superhuman
(Eh, eh, eh, eh)
And if that's what you want, I hate to let you down
(Eh, eh, eh, eh)
I got your hopes up, now I got you hoping
(Eh, eh, eh, eh)
But I'm gonna be the one to let you down


[Verse 2]
Oh, it's such a long and awful lonely fall
Down from this pedestal that you keep putting me on
What if I fall on my face? What if I make a mistake?

If it's okay, a little grace would be appreciated

Remember how we used to like ourselves?

What little light that's left, we need to keep it sacred

I know that you're afraid to let all the dark escape ya
But we could let the light illuminate these hopeless places

[Pre-Chorus]
La, la-la-la-la, la-la
Just let me let you down


[Chorus]
(Eh, eh, eh, eh)
Hey, baby, I'm not your superhuman
(Eh, eh, eh, eh)
And if that's what you want, I hate to let you down
(Eh, eh, eh, eh)
I got your hopes up, now I got you hoping
(Eh, eh, eh, eh)
But I'm gonna be the one to let you down


[Post-Chorus]
La-la-la-la, la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la

[Bridge]
Oh, no, I ain't your hero (Eh, eh, eh)
You're wasting all your faith on me
Oh, no, I know where this goes (Eh, eh, eh)
Think it's safe to say that your savior doesn't look a thing like me


[Pre-Chorus]
La, la-la-la-la, la-la (Don't let me, don't let me, don't let me)
Don't let me let you down

[Chorus]
(Eh, eh, eh, eh)
Hey, baby, I'm not your superhuman
(Eh, eh, eh, eh)
And if that's what you want, I hate to let you down
(Eh, eh, eh, eh)
I got your hopes up, now I got you hoping
(Eh, eh, eh, eh)
But I'm gonna be the one to let you down
(Eh, eh, eh, eh)
Hey, baby, I'm not your superhuman
(Eh, eh, eh, eh)
And if that's what you want, I hate to let you down
(Eh, eh, eh, eh)
I got your hopes up, now I got you hoping
(Eh, eh, eh, eh)
But I'm gonna be the one to let you down"
No Friend,After Laughter,"[Spoken Intro: Aaron Weiss]

Found these old letters from years ago

Felt it was fitting to continue that correspondence
Can't help I'm sentimental
Thanks for talking with me today
I hope this is helpful for you
I also hope that Birdie
is happy and healthy
And staying out of trouble to a reasonable extent
What I wrote was sort of my way of finally being able to address how it feels to have…


[Verse: Aaron Weiss]

Another brick-red room
, another black-top town

Another misspelled band
burning their own houses down

Another pine-box tune to fill the cemetery day

Another star
, a touch of orange over purgatory gray

Another thorny field to scatter fruitless seed
Another song that runs too long
, God knows no one needs
More misguided ghosts
, more transparent hands

To drop a nickel in our basket and we'll do our RIOT! dance

Beneath another burning sky
, behind our painted lips

In scores of catatonic smile-covered ankle-bitten ships

Throw your pedestal of stone in the forgetful sea
As protection from the paper-thin
perfection you project on me
And when this repetition ends, behind the window shades

A semi-conscious sorrow sleeping in the bed I've made

That most unrestful bed, that most original of sins
And you'll say
that's what I get when I let ambition win
Again
, I'd hate to let you down
, so I'll let the waters rise
And drown my dull reflection in the naïve expectation in your eyes
Back in a cast bit-part
, back when I felt most free
I had a butcher's heart and no one thought they knew me

So before the regiment resumes, before the dreaded sun appears

My driver's waiting, so let's make one point crystal clear

You see a flood-lit form, I see a shirt design
I'm no savior of yours and you're no friend of mine

[Chorus: Aaron Weiss]
You're no friend of mine, you're no friend of mine
I'm no savior of yours and you're no friend of mine
You see a flood-lit form, I see a shirt design
I'm no savior of yours and you're no friend of mine


[Spoken Outro: Aaron Weiss]
…To see myself in the reflection of people's eyes
Realizing that what they see may not even be close to the image I see in myself

And I think I might actually be more afraid to let my own self down than anything else
I feel like the man in the story who saw a bear floating in the river and thought it was a fur coat

Twelve years ago, I stood on the shore and jumped in and grabbed the coat

The river was rushing toward a waterfall
And my friend stood on the shore and shouted to let go of the coat and swim back to land

I let go of the coat, but the coat won't let go of me

In any case, please let me know if there's more I can give you
If nothing comes of it, then just know we are grateful"
Tell Me How,After Laughter,"[Verse 1]
I can't call you a stranger
But I can't call you

I know you think that I erased you

You may hate me, but I can't hate you
And I won't replace you


[Chorus]
Tell me how to feel about you now
Tell me how to feel about you now
Oh, let me know
Do I suffocate or let go?


[Verse 2]
Think I'm tired of getting over it
And just starting something new again

I'm getting sick of the beginnings
And always coming to your defenses

I guess it's good to get it off my chest
I guess I can't believe I haven't yet

You know I got my own convictions
And they're stronger than any addiction

But no one's winning


[Chorus]
Tell me how to feel about you now
Tell me how to feel about you now
Oh, let me know
Do I suffocate or let go?
Tell me how to feel about you now
Tell me how to feel about you now
Oh, let me know
Do I suffocate or let go?

[Bridge]
Keep me up with your silence
Take me down with your quiet
Of all the weapons you fight with
Your silence is the most violent


[Chorus]
Tell me how to feel about you now
Tell me how to feel about you now
Oh, let me know
Do I suffocate or let go?
Tell me how to feel about you now
Tell me how to feel about you now
Oh, let me know
Do I suffocate or let go?


[Outro]
You don't have to tell me if you ever think of me

I know you see me dancing wildly in the fog of your memory

You don't have to tell me
, I can still believe"
This Is Why,This Is Why,"[Verse 1]
If you have an opinion
Maybe you should shove it

Or maybe you could scream it

Might be best to keep it


[Pre-Chorus]
To yourself (To yourself)
To yourself (To yourself)


[Chorus]
This is why I don't leave the house

You say the coast is clear
But you won't catch me out

Oh, why?
This is why


[Verse 2]
Better have conviction
'Cause we want crimes of passion
Survival of the fittest
You're either with us or you can keep it


[Pre-Chorus]
To yourself (To yourself)
To yourself (To yourself)
To yourself, yourself, yourself
To yourself (To yourself)

[Chorus]
This is why I don't leave the house

You say the coast is clear
But you won't catch me out
Oh, why?
This is why
This is why I don't leave the house

You say the coast is clear
But you won't catch me out
Oh, why?
This is why


[Bridge]
One step beyond your door
It might as well have been a free fall

One step beyond your door
Falling down an endless hall
One step beyond your door
Might as well have been a free fall
One step beyond your door
And I'm floating like a cannonball


[Chorus]
This is why I don't leave the house

You say the coast is clear
But you won't catch me out
Oh, why?
This is why
This is why I don't leave the house

You say the coast is clear
But, oh no, you won't catch me out
Oh, why?
This is why"
The News,This Is Why,"[Verse 1]
War, a war, a war on the far side
On the other side of the planet

And I've got war, a war, a war right behind my eyes
Right behind them just like a headache


[Pre-Chorus]
So I turn on the news
Turn off the news


[Chorus]
Every second, our collective heart breaks
All together, every single head shakes

Shut your eyes, but it won't go away
Turn on, turn off the news

Every second, our collective heart breaks
All together, every single head shakes

Shut your eyes, but it won't go away
Turn on, turn off the news


[Verse 2]
Far, I'm far, so far from the front line
Quite the opposite, I'm safe inside

But I worry and I give money and I feel useless behind this computer

And that's just barely scratched the surface of my mind

[Pre-Chorus]
So I turn on the news
Turn off the news
Turn on the news
Turn off the news


[Chorus]
Every second, our collective heart breaks
All together, every single head shakes

Shut your eyes, but it won't go away
Turn on, turn off the news

Every second, our collective heart breaks
All together, every single head shakes

Shut your eyes, but it won't go away
Turn on, turn off the news


[Bridge]
Exploitative, performative
Informative and we don't know the half of it

Rhetorical, deplorable
Historical, and all along, we called it normal

Exploitative, performative
(Turn on)
Informative and we don't know the half of it

Rhetorical, deplorable
(Turn off)
Historical, and all along, we called it normal
All along, we called it normal

[Chorus]
Every second, our collective heart breaks
All together, every single head shakes

Shut your eyes, but it won't go away
Turn on, turn off the news

Every second, our collective heart breaks
All together, every single head shakes

Shut your eyes, but it won't go away
Turn on, turn off the news"
Running Out Of Time,This Is Why,"[Verse 1]
Said I was gonna take some flowers to my neighbor
, but I
Ran out of time

Didn't wanna show up to the party empty-handed, but I
Ran out of time

Said I'd walk the dog a little further than the driveway tonight
The extra mile

Thought I'd send a card with my condolences, but, damn, I
Just ran out of time


[Pre-Chorus]
Intentions only get you so far
What if I'm just a selfish prick? No regard, ah


[Chorus]
I'm always running out of time
I'm always running out of time


[Verse 2]
Never mind, I hit the snooze on my alarm twenty times
But I was just so tired

There was traffic, spilled my coffee, crashed my car, otherwise
Woulda been here on time

Shoulda, coulda, wouldn't matter, ultimate alibi
You know it's a lie
There was a fire (Metaphorically)

Be there in five (Hyperbolically)

[Pre-Chorus]
Intentions only get you so far
(It was on my list, I swear I meant to get to it)

A harsh reality to discover, ah

[Chorus]
I'm always running out of time

(She's always running out of time)

I'm always running out of time


[Bridge]
Why we gotta be in a rush?
My watch is just for decoration, mm

Look, I showed up early for once
Now that's a new sensation, mm

[Chorus]
We're always running out of time

(She's always running out of time)

I'm always running out of time
I'm always running out of time

(She's always running out of time, out of time)

I'm always running out of time"

C'est comme ça, c'est comme ça

Na-na-na-na-na-na-na

[Verse 1]
In a single year, I've aged one hundred

My social life: a chiropractic appointment

Sit still long enough to listen to yourself
Or maybe just long enough for you to atrophy to hell

[Chorus]
C'est comme ça, c'est comme ça

Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
C'est comme ça, c'est comme ça

Na-na-na-na-na-na-na

[Verse 2]
I'm off caffeine on doctor's orders
Said it was gonna help to level out my hormones

Lucky for me, I run on spite and sweet revenge

It's my dependence on the friction that really hinders my progression

[Pre-Chorus]
I know that regression is rarely rewarded
I still need a certain degree of disorder


[Chorus]
C'est comme ça, c'est comme ça

Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
C'est comme ça, c'est comme ça

Na-na-na-na-na-na-na

C'est comme ça, c'est comme ça

Na-na-na-na-na-na-na

[Bridge]
I know that regression is rarely rewarded
I still need a certain degree of disorder

I hate to admit gettin' better is boring
But the high cost of chaos, who can afford it?

C'est comme ça, c'est comme ça

Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
C'est comme ça, c'est comme ça

Na-na-na-na-na-na-na

"Big Man, Little Dignity",This Is Why,"[Verse 1]
Don't mean to stare at you from across the room
It's like I'm glued to the sheer sight of you
And you're so smooth, it's pitiful
Know you could get away with anything, so that's exactly what you do


[Chorus]
Big man, ooh
Little dignity

Big man, ooh
Little dignity
No offense, but you
You got no integrity

Big man, ooh
Ooh-la-la-la, little dignity

[Verse 2]
Well, well, well, look at you, don't you clean up nice?

Bet it feels good to leave the past behind
Your subscription to redemption has been renewed

You keep your head high, smooth operator in a shit-stained suit


[Chorus]
Big man, ooh
Little dignity
Big man, ooh
Little dignity

No offense, but you
You got no integrity

Big man, ooh
Ooh-la-la-la, little dignity

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, I can't look away

[Bridge]
I memorized all your lines

I can't look away, you're like a movie that I love to hate
I fantasize your demise

I should look away because I know you're never gonna change
I keep thinkin' this time, the end'll be different
But it isn't

I keep thinkin' (Keep thinkin') the end is gonna be different
But you keep on winning


[Chorus]
Big man, ooh
Little dignity
Big man, ooh
Little dignity

No offense, but you
You got no integrity

Big man, ooh
Ooh-la-la-la, little dignity

You First,This Is Why,"[Verse 1]
Living well is not my kind of revenge

You should take it from me
Living well is just a privilege

Thought I'd simmer down as I got older

Can't shake the devil sitting on my shoulder

Who invited you?

[Pre-Chorus]
Just like a stray animal
I keep feeding scraps
I give it my energy
And it keeps on coming back

But just like a stray animal
I keep feeding scraps
I give it my energy
And it keeps on coming


[Chorus]
Everyone is a bad guy
And there's no way to, no way to know
Who's the worst

Karma's gonna come for all of us
And I hope, well, I hope, I just hope
She comes, comes for you first, oh

[Verse 2]
Which wolf wins?
I guess it really depends, just gotta wait and see
Which one's appetite's the biggest

Turns out I'm livin' in a horror film
Where I'm both the killer and the final girl
So who, who are you?


[Pre-Chorus]
Just like a stray animal
I keep feeding scraps
I give it my energy
And it keeps on coming back
But just like a stray animal
I keep feeding scraps
I give it my energy
And it keeps on coming


[Chorus]
Everyone is a bad guy
And there's no way to, no way to know
Who's the worst
'Cause karma's gonna come for all of us
And I hope, well, I hope, I just hope
She comes, comes for you first, oh

[Bridge]
Never said I wasn't petty
Never said I wasn't petty
I never said I wasn't petty
You can bet I don't regret it for a second
It's a pleasure, it's a reckoning
Never said I wasn't petty
I'll do better when you're better
Let me revel in your defeat

[Chorus]
Everyone is a bad guy
And there's no way to, no way to know
Who's the worst
But karma's gonna come for all of us
And I hope, well, I hope, I just hope
She comes, comes for you first, oh"
Figure 8,This Is Why,"[Verse 1]
Drained me dry, down to the last drop

Pearls before swine
, all flowers die

Tapped the last good vein

Don't know how to shut it off


[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, once you get me going
(I don't know how to stop, I don't know how to stop)
Once you get me going
(I don't know how to stop, I don't know how to)


[Chorus]
All for your sake
Became the very thing that I hate

I lost my way

Spinnin' in an endless figure eight


[Verse 2]
I won't miss the feelin'

My flimsy spine, unsuspicious mind

I was only bein' kind
But you mistook me for weak


[Pre-Chorus]
And once I get going, mm
I don't know how to stop, I don't know how to stop
Going
I don't know how to stop, I don't know how to

[Chorus]
All for your sake
Became the very thing that I hate

I lost my way

Spinnin' in an endless figure eight


[Bridge]
Candlelight, candlelight
Burnin' 'til broad daylight

Candlelight, candlelight
Burnin' at both ends tonight

How could I? How could I?
If I'm made of thin ice
How could I? How could I?
You'd be wise if you thought twice


[Chorus]
All for your sake
Became the very thing that I hate

I lost my way

Spinnin' in an endless figure

What remains
And now I think I'm losing my shape
Not a trace

No end and no beginning, figure eight"
Liar,This Is Why,"[Verse 1]
What was the moment? It's hard to say
I'm sure I don't remember anyway
Before I only knew to hesitate
Pin back in the grenade


[Pre-Chorus]
And all the ways I'd keep you safe
I keep you safe from me

[Chorus]
And, oh, my love, I lied to you
But I never needed to
Oh, my love, I lied to you
But you always knew the truth


[Verse 2]
I got too good at fighting chemicals
And dodgin' arrows I was asking for

Wading through the fog and then it disappeared
Naked when I'm here


[Pre-Chorus]
And why (And why) should I (Should I) deny what's all
At once so crystal clear?

[Chorus]
And, oh, my love, I lied to you
But I never needed to
Oh, my love, I lied to you
But you always knew the truth


[Bridge]
Love is not an easy thing to admit
But I'm not ashamed of it
Love is not a weakening if you feel it rushin' in
Don't be ashamed of it
Mm, love is not an easy thing to admit
But I'm not ashamed of it
Mm, love is not a weakening if you feel it rushin' in
Don't be ashamed of it

[Chorus]
And, oh, my love, I lied to you
But I never needed to
Oh, my love, I lied to you
But you always knew the truth
And, oh, my love, I lied to you
But I never needed to
Oh, my love, I lied to you
But you always knew the truth"
Crave,This Is Why,"[Verse 1]

I can't wait to memorize this day
Oh, a picture could not contain the way it feels

You say, ""Live in the present""
I'm already dreamin' of how it begins
And tryin' to savor the moment
But I know the feelin' will come to an end


[Chorus]
So I crave, crave
To do it again, all again

Crave, crave
To do it again, I
Just for a second, it all felt simple
I'm already missin' it

So I crave, crave
To do it again, all again

[Verse 2]
I romanticize even the worst of times
When all it took to make me cry was bein' alive

Look up and see a reflection
Of someone who never gave way to the pain

What if I told 'em that now that I'm older
There isn't a moment that I'd wanna change?

[Chorus]
Now I crave, crave
To do it again, all again
Crave, crave
To do it again, I
Just for a second, it all felt simple
I'm already missin' it
So I crave, crave
To do it again, all again

[Bridge]
Any second, feel the present
Future and the past connectin'
Any second, feel the present
Future and the past connectin'


[Chorus]
Crave, crave
To do it again (To do it), all again
Crave, crave
To do it again, I
Just for a second, it all felt simple
I'm already missin' it
So I crave, crave
To do it again, all again"
Thick Skull,This Is Why,"[Intro]
I am a magnet for broken pieces
I am attracted to broken people

I pick 'em up and now my fingers are bleedin'
And it looks like my fault
And it looks like I'm caught red-handed


[Chorus]
Hit over the head
Epiphany
Over my head
Repeatedly
Thick skull never did
Nothing for me

Same lesson again?

Come on, give it to me, give it to me
Give it to me, give it to me

Only I know where all the bodies are buried
Thought by now, I'd find 'em just a little less scary

Might get easier, but you don't get used to it
Keep on autopilot, mm

Hey, hey
What's the body count up to now, captain?

[Chorus]
Hit over the head
Epiphany
Over my head

Thick skull never did
Nothing for me

Come on out with your hands up
Come on out with your hands up
I'm comin' out with my hands up, mm
Come on out with your hands up

Thick skull never did

Same lesson again?

Sanity (demo),Re: This Is Why,"[Verse 1]
Sanity, why must you make a fool of me?
You've been a friend to me, now I think that we're enemies
Eh, eh


[Pre-Chorus]

If I fall on my knees, I hear you laughing

If I call out your name, you don't come


[Chorus]

No one home, but the void is loud
(This must be the void)
Echoes around my empty house
(This must be the void)
Synapses are slowing down

This must be the void they always talk about
This must be the void

Levity, fill me up, let me flow
I'll let you take care of me, you can help me let go

If I fall on my knees, I hear you laughing

If I call out your name, you don't come

No one home, but the void is loud (This must be the void)
Echoes around my empty house (This must be the void)
Synapses are slowing down
This must be the void they always talk about

Echoes around my empty house (This must be the void)
Synapses are slowing down

Finally, I have arrived
Finally, I have arrived (And there is nothing to see)
Finally, I have arrived (And there is nothing to breathe)
Finally, I have arrived, arrived, arrived, arrived

Echoes around my empty house (This must be the void)
